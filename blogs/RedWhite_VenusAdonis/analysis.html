        <h2>The Strategy</h2>
        <p>Initially the plan was only to count how many times the words "red" and "white" or words which imply those colors, such as 
          "blushing" and "pale" appeared together either in the same verse or in the same stanza.  As there are 199 stanzas of 6 verses 
          each = 1194 verses, this seemed
          like a good opportunity to try the programming language Python to accelerate the process but then the question became, how do
          I come up with an adequate list of words to search for? Seeing as it is Shakespeare, the prospect of trying to think of words
          that might be used seemed inadequate in a way that I could hear the creator of his own vocabulary rolling in his grave.  
          Not only might I miss numerous
          words, but also, why search for words that aren't there?  So, I used Python to count unique words in the text and put them into 
          a <a  href="python/outputfile.csv">CSV file</a> which lists the 2574 unique words and the number of times each appears in the text.
         
          </p>
        
          <p>Going through the list to find relevant words I noticed a lot of pairs of opposites and so gave the list to ChatGPT and 
            asked the bot to sort out pairs of opposites from it. It returned a list of more than 60 pairs. Some of those were 
            redundant such as quick/slow and fast/slow, and some had been missed.  So, I addded and removed from the original list of pairs 
            and settled on 72 pairs simply for the sake of presentation--if 72 pairs doesn't make the point, 73 won't either.  Note that 
            only single words are searched for here and more opposites would likely be found if phrases were included, such as danger / 
            "where never serpent hisses", nor did I include traditional Alchemical pairings: gold / silver, sun / moon, fire / water or red / white.

        <p>Resuming the search for red and white, the list of unique words posed its own challenges as I meant to include words 
          that imply color such as blood, snow, milk, etc. as I already know they are used for such purposes--as in the following verses </p>
        <p class="quote shake">
          Whose <span class="white">frothy</span> mouth bepainted all with <span class="red">red</span>,
          Like <span class="white">milk</span> and <span class="red">blood</span> being mingled both together,
        </p>
        <p> but where to draw the line?  Coming up with 
          a list of red and white terms was to serve two purposes.
          <ol>
            <li>to compare all colors by count</li>
            <li>to count pairings of red and white terms within stanzas and verses.</li>
          </ol>
          The word "<span class="red">fire</span>" Shakespeare uses three times to imply red or with red, but fire is 
          used 14 times in the text and most of those it appears only to imply heat, anger, love, or passion, more than color.  
          For the color comparision, fire was left out of the grouping of red, though the results show that including 
          it would 
          be superfluous.

        Using the list of red and white terms above, a second search was done using Python to find stanzas and verses where a red and white term 
        appear together.  One change to the list was made though. Purple was added to the red column, as purple didn't mean in Shakespeare's time what 
        it does now, i.e. a mix of red and blue, but could be used for a range of hue from violet to dark or rich reds.  Twice in the poem, Shakespeare
        uses purple to denote the color of blood. It was put in its own column above simply for the benefit of the doubt.

    By this the boy that by her side lay kill’d
    Was melted like a vapour from her sight
    And in his <span class="red">blood</span> that on the ground lay spill’d
    A <span class="red">purple</span> flower sprung up chequer’d with <span class="white">white</span>   
        Resembling well his <span class="white">pale</span> cheeks and the <span class="red">blood</span>

        </div>

        <p> Looking at the first and last stanzas above, we see in both a description of a red and white flower.  The first 
          is a description of Adonis by Venus who calls him "the field's chief flower, sweet above compare (...)
          more white and red than doves and roses are." and the last is of the flower that grows from his blood, 
          "resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood which in round drops upon their whiteness stood."</p>
        <p>Recall that in the Orphic Hymn to Adonis, he is called "Sweet plant of Aphrodite (Venus), Love's (Eros/Cupid)
          delightful flower."
        </p>

            color of blood and once for the Sun's face at sunset. So, what we see in the last stanza listed above 
            calls back not only to the second stanza of the poem where Adonis is 
            “The field’s chief flower, sweet above compare,
           (...) More white and red than doves or roses are," but also to the first three verses of the poem:
        </p> 
        <p class='quote shake'>
            Even as the sun with purple-colored face
            Had ta’en his last leave of the weeping morn,
            Rose-cheeked Adonis hied him to the chase.
        </p>
        <p>The purple blood on Adonis' face in death is analogous to the purple face of the Sun as it sets, i.e. it is "blood-colored".
            And, like women of Rome weeping 
            for Adonis, the morn in Shakespeare's poem is "weeping" for the Sun who has "ta'en his last leave". 
            So, not only does the setting sun foreshadow the death of Adonis,
            but furthermore points to the idea that the myth has its origin in the Sun's cycle, as if Shakespeare is saying:
            Had Adonis paid attention to the sign in the sky, he wouldn't have gone on the chase. 
        </p>

            For, he being dead, with him is beauty slain,
 And, beauty dead, black chaos comes again.
