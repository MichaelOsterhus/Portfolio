            The roots of Alchemy are ancient and ideas expressed by Alchemists of Renaissance Europe can be found also 
            expressed by Greek philosophers, Indian gurus, or ancient Chinese sages, but the origins of Alchemical symbols 
            are 
            not so apparent, which could be because, in European history, there is a gap. The Alchemy of the Greco-Roman world 
            seems to have vanished from Europe with the rise of Christianity, though Christianity arguably has 
            a brand of Alchemy all its own. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Almost a thousand years after the birth of Christ, what is commonly called Alchemy and its companion religion
            Hermeticism were reintroduced to Christian Europe from the 
            Muslim state of Andalusia. The general philosophical infusion from Al-Andalus, which brought even Greek 
            philosophy back to the region from which it sprang, was influential
            in the cultural transformation seen as a rebirth, hence called the Renaissance.
            <!-- That being said, i've yet to find a pre-Renaissance source that uses the Red King and White Queen symbolism.
            Red and white, however, have long had symbolic meaning, but not necessarily as opposites.  -->
        </p>
        <p>With this rebirth of "classical" ideals and values came a contagious interest in Greco-Roman mythology that lasted
            for centuries. The Roman myth of Venus and Adonis was not only the subject of Shakespeare's poem, but of many paintings. 

        </p>
        <h2>The Concoction of Art and Alchemy</h2>
        <p>Art had a different place in the social landscape in the middle of the second millennium than it does now. Whereas art in modern 
            times is mostly seen as an avenue for artists to express their individual identity, to prove their uniqueness, or just to make money, 
            artists in the Renaissance, especially among their patrons, were akin to priests.  In Alchemy, Art is seen as a complement to Nature, 
            though this is Art in the sense of skill or craft, as in the Art of Healing, so Alchemy itself is called the "Royal Art".  
            When it came to the transformation of society though, 
            the Arts as we generalize them now were seen as "like leaven which a woman took and measured and kneaded throughout her dough".
            This perspective is known to have affected works of art (painting) and architecture.  Cathedrals, for example, were often built 
            with the belief that the design of the building itself could facilitate what we might call the religious experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of the paintings done from the 1400s - 1700s at least were commissioned by wealthy patrons to serve as transformative agents.
            Hence, many of these paintings have, as their subject, elements of mythology--which arguably serves the same purpose.  If one looks,
            one might find evidence that the same was true for poetry.
        </p>

            One wealthy family in particular, credited with the flourshing of the Italian Renaissance by their funds, was the Medici.
            Cosimo de Medici (1389 to 1464), the founder of the Medici Dynasty was known for his infuation with exotic philosophical texts coming 
            from outside Christian Europe, notably the Hermetica and NeoPlationist texts. Hermeticism and 
            Alchemy are joined at the hip and Hermes is often held up as the patron god this art.
        </p>
        <p>Cosimo I de' Medici (1519-1574), a descendant of Cosimo the Elder's brother, built an Alchemist laboratory in the Palazzo Vecchio 
            (townhall) where his son Francesco is depicted working in the painting on left.  In this laboratory, 
            adorned with paintings and sculptures, artists and alchemists would meet.
        </p>
        <p>The Medici were known for patronizing famous artists such as Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Boticelli. One such patronage
            relevant here was Marie de Medici's patronage of the painter, Peter Paul Rubens.  Browsing the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_de%27_Medici_cycle#:~:text=The%20Marie%20de'%20Medici%20Cycle,in%20the%20autumn%20of%201621.">
                Marie de Medici Cycle
            </a>, a series
            of paintings commisioned to Rubens in 1622, the prominence of red and white is apparent.  The two examples below:
            Left: The Education of the Princess (Marie), Right: The Coronation of Maria de Medici

        </div>
        <p>In the Education of the Princess, we see the young Maria attended by the Three Graces,  
            as well as a floating man in a winged helmet we can safely assume is Hermes. Compare to Boticelli's 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primavera_%28Botticelli%29"><i>Primavera</i></a> (1470 - 1480)</p>
        <p>Of course, Marie was not the only patron of Rubens. King Philip IV of Spain commissioned him to do a series of more 
            than 60 paintings on themes from Ovid's Metamorphoses. </p>

        <h2>The Challenger Mars</h2>
        <p>The use of red and white in paintings of Venus and Adonis appears also in paintings of Mars and Venus.
            Mars and Adonis are typically viewed as distinct deities, and
            they are associated with different planets from among the 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_planet">Seven Classical Planets</a>, Adonis  
            with the Sun, Mars with the "red planet".  But then, Venus wasn't only associated 
            with the planet of her name, but also with the Moon. Also worth noting that Mars and Venus are the two 
            planets on either side of the Earth in the rank of orbits, which leaves the possibility that they represent 
            the two extremes 
            for which the Earth is

            that they are candidates for this position should be 
            considered because from among the symbols for the planets and various pairs of Alchemical symbols linked 
            with the royal couple, it was the symbols for Mars and Venus that came to represent the sexes.

            In Shakespeare's poem, Venus tries to persuade Adonis to love by telling him how she subdued and softened
            Mars, a conquering god without rival.

        <p>Red and white as individual
            colors have had significant symbolic meaning for thousands of years in the general culture. 
            Some of this may be due to nothing more than
             emotional or unconscious
            response to colors in general, hence red's regular use in expressing love, and white's seemingly universal 
            association with innocence. Some of red's significance can be attributed to 
            its place among the three primary colors recognized as early as the Roman Empire: red, blue, and yellow,
            which not coincidentally are colors associated with royalty, red being the one most associated with power.
            However, some of the color's significance
            is clearly due to red's association with a chemical compound known from ancient times as cinnabar.
        </p>

        <h3>A Case For Cinnabar</h3>
        <div style="width:280px; float:right; margin-left:20px;">
            <img width="280" src="img/cinnabar.jpg">
            <span class="quote">Cinnabar (Mercury Sulfide)</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Cinnabar is a red salt compound of Sulfur and Mercury mined since prehistoric times.
            In practical use, cinnabar was valued as the go-to source of the liquid metal, mercury, and ground into 
            a powder as a pigment, commonly known as vermillion, for red paint. 
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            The primary prehistoric use of the mineral was grinding it to create vermillion, 
            and its earliest known use for this purpose is at the Neolithic site of Çatalhöyük in Turkey (7000-8000 BC), 
            where wall paintings included cinnabar's vermillion. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thoughtco.com/cinnabar-the-ancient-pigment-of-mercury-170556">

        <h3>🜭</h3>
        <p>Alchemical Symbol for Cinnabar</p>
        <p>
            Being the product of marriage between an acid and a base, salts in general 
            were seen to depict the union of opposites, but among salts, cinnabar was held up as the prime picture. So, Sulfur
            and Mercury were
            also used as symbols for the afore-mentioned king and queen in both Western and Eastern Alchemy, which 
            the Chinese called Yin (Mercury) and Yang (Sulfur). Of course, these two were initially united in one
            essence called Pure Yang (Cinnabar) before separating into their masculine and feminine counterparts. Whether it
            was for qualities possessed by its components or by cinnabar itself, 
            that it held high status is clear.
            In his 'Natural History', the Roman author, Pliny the Elder, states:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            (Cinnabar) is of great importance among pigments at the present day, 
            and also in old times it not only had the highest importance but even sacred associations among the Romans. 
            Verrius gives a list of writers of unquestionable authority who say that on holidays it was the custom for 
            the face of the statue of Jupiter himself to be coloured with cinnabar, as well as the bodies of persons going 
            in a triumphal procession, and that Camillus was so coloured in his triumph, and that under the same ritual 
            it was usual even in their day for cinnabar to be added to the unguents used at a banquet in honour of a triumph, 
            and that one of the first duties of the censors was to place a contract for painting Jupiter with cinnabar. 
            For my own part I am quite at a loss to explain the origin of this custom, although at the present day the 
            pigment in question is known to be in demand among the nations of Ethiopia whose chiefs colour themselves all over with it, 
            and with whom the statues of the gods are of that colour. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Ancients knew how to decompose cinnabar for extracting mercury, but also, how to merge the couple back together 
            again, thus, symbolically, 
            cinnabar was linked with the 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher%27s_stone">Philosopher's Stone</a>, the product of the Chemical Wedding, or even synonymous with it. The Chinese
            term 'Neidan'(內丹) used to refer to esoteric Taoism or Chinese Alchemy is itself composed of two parts:
            Nei(內 = "inner") and dan(丹) which is often translated as "alchemy" but the online dictionary 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/the-meaning-of/chinese-word-330be19f33461a3b2e8600d827856e04a46922bf.html">
                wordhippo.com</a>
              gives
            the definition of 丹 as: red, cinnabar, pellet, powder.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            In China, the earliest known use of cinnabar is the Yangshao culture (~4000-3500 BC). At several sites, 
            cinnabar covered the walls and floors in buildings used for ritual ceremonies. Cinnabar was among a range of minerals 
            used to paint Yangshao ceramics, and, at Taosi village, cinnabar was sprinkled into elite burials.

            It is supposedly for this symbolic significance of cinnabar that 
            the Chinese flag is red. Red in general was seen as the zenith of colors and, like gold, the champion of metals, 
            was linked with the Sun.  So, also in Japan red is linked with the Sun, but more specifically with the Shinto
            Sun-goddess, Amaterasu, who is often depicted in art like the Japanese flag, in red and white.

            third eye, was for thousands of years painted on with vermillion, known in India as sindoor, itself a symbol of marriage. 
            This tradition began 
            in the Harappan civilisation which existed in India from 3300–1300 BCE and persisted until 
            it was discovered that mercury is toxic.  
            Bindi is the feminine form of bindu, the white "point" from which the universe germinated in Shaivism
            described as a white seed (masculine) in red fleshy fruit (feminine), which together are the hermaphrodite deity, 
            Shiva-Shakti.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            The description of Shiva-Shakti as a white seed in red fleshy fruit is opposite the typical Alchemical pairing of 
            color and gender, and is 
            also opposite the pomegranate, a fruit with red seeds and white flesh, though the skin is red... The pomegranate 
            has/had significant symbolic meaning around the world.

        <p>In Sandro Botticeli's 'Madonna of the Pomegranate' (1487) the baby Jesus holds an open pomegranate over his heart, 
             suggesting that its seeds are analogous to the seeds of the Logos which pour out like drops 
            of blood, for the pomegranate is a symbol of resurrection and the Passion of the Christ in Christianity. 
            The Sufi poet Rumi ties the pomegranate, the red anemone and Alchemy together in this short poem, which likens
            the opening of the pomegranate to the opening of the heart, and thus the ripe pomegranate with the spiritually mature:
        </p>
      
        <p class="quote shake">
            If you buy a pomegranate, buy one whose ripeness
            has caused it to be cleft open
            with a seed-revealing smile.

            Its laughter is a blessing, for through its wide-open mouth
            it shows its heart,
            like a pearl in the jewel box of spirit.

            The red anemone laughs, too,
            but through its mouth you glimpse a blackness.

            A laughing pomegranate
            brings the whole garden to life.
            Keeping the company of the holy
            makes you one of them
            Whether you are stone or marble,
            you will become a jewel
            when you reach a human being of heart.

            Plant the love of the holy ones within your spirit;
            don’t give your heart to anything
            but the love of those whose hearts are glad.
            Don’t go to the neighborhood of despair:
            there is hope.
            Don’t go in the direction of darkness:
            suns exist.

            The heart guides you to the neighborhood of the saints;
            the body takes you to the prison of water and earth.
            Give your heart the food of holy friends;
            seek maturity from those who have matured.

        <p>The pomegranate was also a sacred object to Aphrodite/Venus and, along with fertility, symbolized the loss of virginity
            in the consummation of marriage in her religion or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AphroditeTreasures.html">
                symbolism associated with the Goddess
            </a>. Coupling this symbolism of the pomegranate with spiritual awakening and the opening of the heart 
            (as in Rumi's poetry) provides
            a possible link with the Sacred Marriage as a spirtual awakening that is a "popping of the pomegranate" i.e.
            an opening of the heart which is not only a catharsis or 
            release,
            but a loss of virginity, a yielding, a willingness to be spiritually penetrated and surrender to the will of Love. 
        </p>
        <h2>Summing the Total</h2>
        <p>So, we have reason to believe that red's symbolism in Alchemy is Alchemical in origin, i.e. it has probable natural 
            precedents which can serve as foundation for parabolic
            interpretations.  That red would represent the final stage
            in Alchemical transmutation makes sense if cinnabar is seen to epitomize the result of the Chemical Marriage. Where 
            the stages are four: Nigredo (Blackening), Albedo (Whitening), Citrinitas (Yellowing), and Rubedo (Reddening), cinnabar as 
            a natural precedent makes sense as Mercury can be linked with white, and Sulfur with yellow. 
        </p>
        <p>We also have evidence of red and white appearing together in cultural/religious contexts outside of Europe, but not a
            reason as to why these two would be paired together.
        </p>Pending further research, it appears that the Red King and White Queen became prominent symbols in European Alchemy 
            during the Renaissance, but seem to have evolved out of more ancient uses of the colors.
