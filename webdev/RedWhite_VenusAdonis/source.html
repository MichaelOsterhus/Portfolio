        <h1>Shakespeare's Myth of Venus and Adonis</h1>
        
        SHAKESPEARE ALTERS the myth of
        Venus and Adonis so casually that the im-
        portance of his change is not at first ap-
        parent. Instead of being Love's lover, as in
        ancient literary sources,1 Adonis leaves her flat
        on her back and runs off to hunt with the boys.
        This interpretation had appeared before in the
        Renaissance, in Titian and in Marlowe, and
        Shakespeare's treatment may owe something to
        them, to the stories of Narcissus and of Salmacis
        and Hermaphroditus, or to the poet's obscure
        relationship with the Earl of Southampton.2
        Whatever its origin, though, the change threatens
        to make hash of the poem. Advancing on Adonis
        in the first lines, Venus seems to become a
        sweaty, muscular rapist. In the middle, as Adonis
        resists her, the sweet couple fall into a philo-
        sophic bicker over whether Venus or Diana is
        the author of death. At the end, Venus bursts
        into a passionate lament over the dead Adonis,
        which is admirable poetry but is utterly incon-
        sistent with her earlier characterization as a
        comic seducer and immoral lecher. And why is
        Adonis killed for what he didn't do or, worse
        yet, why didn't he do it? The modern reader, as
        J. W. Lever sums it up, usually takes the poem
        as "a very funny story which somehow forgets
        the joke; or as a highly cautionary tale which,
        in showing the dangers of caution, does not
        point the moral at all well."

        A famous poet has remarked that it is hard to
        applaud Venus and Adonis unless one knows the
        rules of the game.4 A basic rule of myth, which
        differentiates it from other stories, is that it has
        some force, or appeal to the imagination, that
        overcomes seeming contradictions and improb-
        abilities. It creates chimeras-serpent, goat, and
        lion held together by unnatural force. Shake-
        speare draws far more than we have realized on
        the highly sophisticated tradition of allegorical
        poetry and painting, so that the various aspects
        of his Venus portray alternately the comic and
        serious qualities of physical love, while the death
        of Adonis suggests the internal contradiction of
        earthly beauty, whose splendor comes at the
        price of transience.5 Yet the poem adds up to no
        homily on love. In the strife between Venus and
        Adonis, Shakespeare holds his conflicting atti-
        tudes toward earthly love in an esthetic balance
        through a form that, in the same iconographic
        tradition, is both narrative and pictorial. This
        form in itself seems to be one solution to that
        characteristic Shakespearean ambivalence, the
        living "in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts,"
        which, as a systematic way of thinking, resem-
        bles primitive myth.

        I. Myth and Meaning
        An acceptable general theory of myth is hard
        to come by. With the passing of the once easy
        rule of the Golden Bough, the territory has been
        reduced to chaos amid the strife of ritualists,
        psychologists, and structuralists.6 One might try
        to reconcile them around the idea of mediation.
        For Frazer, Cassirer, and the ritualists, myth
        intervenes between the sacred and the profane;
        for Freud and Campbell, between the uncon-
        scious and the conscious; for Jung, between the
        individual and the collective; for Levi-Strauss,
        between the polarities and contradictions of a
        social system.7 But even if one could overcome
        the vast differences in methodology involved,
        such a compromise definition can finally be no
        more than an analogue to esthetic form and can
        only account for some rudimentary unity that
        Shakespeare's poem would share with any work
        based on the same myth. To account for Shake-
        speare's variations on the story, myth criticism
        must be joined to literary history, to see how the
        myth developed in the Renaissance, especially in
        the mythographic tradition that largely shaped
        Shakespeare's material.
        Most significant for Shakespeare"s poem was
        the development of the attribute system as a way
        of representing mythic characters in allegorical

        poetry and painting.8 A description of a god or
        goddess in, say, Vincenzo Cartari's Le imagini
        de i dei de gli antichi (1556; 1st illus. ed.,
        1571) will show a unitary figure-suitable for a
        painting, emblem, or medallion-decorated and
        embellished with various attributes, each the
        relic of a story about the deity and the symbol of
        an abstract quality. Venus, for instance, is de-
        scribed with a rose, which recalls how she cut
        her foot as she ran to the dying Adonis and repre-
        sents the painful side of love.

The technique is, of course, not restricted to
pagan subjects. The archangel Raphael, for in-
stance, is regularly depicted with a youth carry-
ing a fish, recalling the tale of Tobias and signi-
fying Raphael's role as the "affable archangel"
who aids and protects men.10 Tobias is his at-
tribute, as the rose is Venus', or the caduceus is
Mercury's. Mythography, then, is not just a con-
tent but a process of representation, a continual
infolding and unfolding of pictorial and narra-
tive forms. It mediates between two modes of
conception, between discursive and nondiscur-
sive thinking: the material of the visual world is
made into narrative, narrative into argument,
and argument into vision.

That Shakespeare uses mythography as a
formal constituent of his poetry is amply il-
lustrated by the figure of Adonis. Arthur Gold-
ing, Shakespeare's favorite translator of Ovid,
wrote in his Dedicatory Epistle to the Earl of
Leicester that Book x of the Metamorphoses
"chiefly doth containe one kind of argument, /
Reprooving most prodigious lusts."11 The
same argument springs to the lips of Adonis
when he rejects Venus. Yet she has a word or
two of answer; and anyway, Adonis' refusal
means that the pair will enact no lusts worthy of
reproof, so Shakespeare's own position must go
beyond Golding's simpleminded moral. Gold-
ing's source, the Regius-Micyllus Ovid, indeed
offers more varied allegory. Historically, the
myth recalls ancient religious festivals in As-
syria.12 Physically interpreted, Adonis repre-
sents the crops of the earth, as Micyllus learned
from scholia in Theocritus, No. 3 (Micyllus, p.
243; cf. Giraldi, p. 397, and Conti, p. 162a).
Or, in Boccaccio's version, Adonis is the sun
and Venus the earth; their love brings forth lush
flowers, leaves, and ripe fruit. But winter is like
the boar that slays the beautiful Adonis, for then
the sun seems banished from our world, Venus
mourns, the earth lies barren.l3
The most common interpretation, though, is
suggested by Ovid himself. When Adonis is
changed to a flower at the end of his tale, he
writes:

. .. brevis est tamen usus in illo [flore];
namque male haerentem et nimia levitate caducum
excutiunt idem, qui praestant nomina, venti.14

. . But short-lived is their flower;
for the winds from which it takes its name shake
off the flower
so delicately clinging and doomed too easily to fall.
This sense of transience acquires almost pro-
verbial weight as it is repeated by mythogra-
phers. Boccaccio writes:

But as to the fact that Adonis is transformed into a
flower: by that invention I think is shown to us the
brevity of beauty, which in the morning is richly
colored, but at a late hour, drooping and pale, grows
feeble; and so mankind in the morn, that is, in the
time of youth, is blooming and splendid; but in the
eve, that is, in the time of old age, we grow pale,
and we fall into the shadows of death.15
What this philosophical interpretation has in
common with the physical is the importance
given to flowers. In one case, Adonis is like a
flower; in the other, he causes flowers. Both
statements describe the action of Shakespeare's
poem. Its opening lines link Adonis to the purple
sun:

Even as the sun with purple-colour'd face
Had ta'en his last leave of the weeping mor
Rose-cheek'd Adonis hied him to the chase.'1
At the end, his purple blood begets a flower:
And in his blood that on the ground lay spill'd,
A purple flower sprung up, checker'd with
white,
Resembling well his pale cheeks and the
blood
Which in round drops upon their whiteness
stood. (11. 1167-70)
Throughout, he is linked to f
a metaphor for his beauty:
"Thrice fairer than myself,"
"The field's chief flower, sw
S. Clark Hulse
Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,
More white and red than doves or roses are."
(11. 7-10)
The realization that Adonis is Beauty, which
fadeth like the flower, explains his peculiar,
unmotivated death. Beauty fades, flowers wither,
no matter what. His death does not show a
doom that awaits lechery, since he will have
none, and Venus (who he does think is a lecher)
has sought to protect him. Certainly it does not
prove that sex is very nice; it proves simply that
beauty fades. In short, the sequence of the nar-
rative is not finally a causal or argumentative
sequence; rather, it is an unfolding of Adonis'
attributes, a making explicit of what is implicit
in line 8-"the field's chief flower." Shakespeare
can say he is a flower, while a painter would
show him with a flower; the narrative repeats
this attribute by showing him becoming a flower.
Narratively, he must die to become that flower,
and what the flower means is that he must die.
If Shakespeare's portrayal of Adonis is decep-
tive only because it is so simple, the portrait of
Venus is a genuine problem. That Venus is Love
is axiomatic; that she is earthly love is quickly
apparent.17 Adonis calls her Lust; she herself
claims to be fruitful and generative; and her
hand is moist, the proper characteristic of a
passionate lover. George Wyndham, the first
modern critic of the poem, likened her to Botti-
celli's Venus, rising from the foam.l8 But, if she
is born of the sea, it is in Abraham Fraunce's
sense:

She is borne of the sea, lovers are inconstant, like
the troubled waves of the sea: Hereof was she also
called Aphrodite, of the froath of the sea, being
like to Spermna.

Shakespeare's description of her is a meta-
phoric catalog of the characteristics of physical
love. When he wishes to show that love is light,
that is, merry and delightful, he says that Venus
does not weigh much:

"Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie:
These forceless flowers like sturdy trees sup-
port me.
Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be
That thou should think it heavy unto thee?"
(11. 151-56)

The pun is outrageous, and the figure contorted,
for its literal and metaphoric senses have re-
versed positions. As Cartari prescribes, the prin-
cipal characteristics of the god are those that
signify the god's nature and effects (p. 16). We
are used to the physical being the literal, but
literally Venus is delightful, and so she is figured
as if she were light in weight. But, curiously, this
reversal changes the impact of the image; in-
stead of seeing a sylph supported on flowers, we
see tree trunks, holding aloft an awesome bulk.
This is the core of the poem's problem. If one
grants that Venus is earthly love, what is the
attitude toward earthly love? Is it loathsome,
foul lust? Delightful sense? A near-sacred force
of natural propagation?

The most casual glance at the sonnets would
remind us that Shakespeare is perfectly capable
of portraying love in all three ways. Venus and
Adonis opens in travesty, as if love were some-
thing that reduces humans to the grotesque and
foolish:

Over one arm the lusty courser's rein,
Under her other was the tender boy,
(11. 31-32)

Backward she push'd him, as she would be
thrust,
And govern'd him in strength, though not in
lust. (11. 41-42)

"Were I hard-favour'd, foul, or wrinkled old,
Ill-nurtur'd, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,
O'erworn, despised, rheumatic and cold,
Thick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice,
Then mightst thou pause, for then I were
not for thee." (11. 133-37)

He wrings her nose, he strikes her on
cheeks,
He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard.
(11. 475-76)

She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck;
He on her belly falls, she on her back.
(11. 593-94)

If the moments of direct physical contact are
ludicrous, the passages of enticement reveal the
sensuality that led Francis Meres to call Shake-
speare "Mellifluous & hony-tongued":
"Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,
Or like a fairy trip upon the green,
Or like a nymph, with long dishevell'd hair,
Dance on the sands, and yet no footing
seen." (11. 145-48)

"Sweet bottom grass and high delightful
plain,
Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and
rough,
To shelter thee from tempest and from rain:
Then be my deer, since I am such a park."
(11. 236-39)
These two moods have won the poem its
reputation for comic sensuousness. But there is
another tone, like to that of Sonnet 129-"The
expense of spirit in a waste of shame"-in which
love is presented as a violent force of destruc-
tion:

Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,
Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone,
Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste,
Till either gorge be stuff'd or prey be gone:
Even so she kiss'd his brow, his cheek, his
chin. (11. 55-59)

And having felt the sweetness of the spoil,
With blindfold fury she begins to forage;
Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood
doth boil,

And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage,
Planting oblivion, beating reason back,
Forgetting shame's pure blush and honour's
wrack. (11. 553-58)

We have, in effect, not one but three Venuses
-comic, sensual, and violent-all embodying
earthly love but differently depicted to reveal
different aspects. Venus is the empty eagle, the
randy jennet, the tender snail, the anguished
milch doe, and the timid hare. Even the boar is
finally her animal. Traditionally, the boar repre-
sents jealousy, because Mars took its shape to
eliminate his rival.2? In Shakespeare's version,
Mars has been mastered by Venus, who is her-
self the jealous one, that is, possessive of Adonis.
When first the boar is mentioned, she quakes
with fear of loss:

"For where love reigns, disturbing jealousy
Doth call himself affection's sentinel;
Distemp'ring gentle love in his desire,
As air and water do abate the fire."
(11. 649-54)

So, when the boar appears, he possesses Adonis
with a firm embrace that Venus can only envy:
"And nuzzling in his flank, the loving swine
Sheath'd unaware the tusk in his soft groin.
"Had I been tooth'd like him, I must confess,
With kissing him I should have kill'd him
first."21 (11. 1115-18)

Venus is a series of images, e
the strange animal-headed fi
the pages of Cartari. Contr
require contradictory figure
Venus five different ways, an
Shakespeare, groups three dif
the same frame (Cartari, p. 5
Too much can be made of the "character" of
Shakespeare's Venus. She is no Lady Macbeth
or Prince Hamlet. The idea of character requires
a personality continuous over a period of time.
But not the allegorical figure, as Dante explained
in La vita nuova: one "could be puzzled at my
speaking of Love as if it were a thing in itself, as
if it were not only an intellectual substance, but
also a bodily substance. This is patently false,
for Love does not exist in itself as a substance,
but is an accident in a substance."22 Shake-
speare's mythic goddess is not so much a person
as a diverse group of actions inhabiting a single
body.

II. Visual Syntax
If the characters of Venus and Adonis show
the kinship in this instance between poetry and
the visual arts, they may also remind us of
Lessing's warning about the fundamental differ-
ence between the arts. Painting, he says, em-
ploys figures and colors in space and imitates
bodies; poetry articulates sounds in time and
imitates actions.23 The mythographic depiction
of Shakespeare's characters gives them a self-
contained unity, a perfect balance of action and
physique within each figure. But that very com-
pleteness within the figures transforms the tradi-
tional relationship between them: Adonis no
longer needs an affair with Venus to define him-
self. Shakespeare goes further still, making
Adonis not just indifferent to Venus but down-
right disdainful of her. This novel arrangement,
we may recall, was devised by Titian, in whose
painting we may find mythographic structures
that break down Lessing's dichotomy between
iconic and discursive forms and offer a model
for Shakespeare's handling of the affair.
98
S. Clark Hulse
Titian's Venus and Adonis is built around
conflict-Adonis pulls away, Venus restrains
him. Dogs and boar spear are his attributes; an
overturned urn is hers. In the background is an
inert, winged figure, his bow and quiver hanging
from a nearby tree. Panofsky identifies him as a
sleeping Cupid, symbolic of cool passions
(Titian, p. 151). Ovid and others, though, tell
us of the resemblance of Adonis to Cupid; they
look so much alike that, unless one had wings
and the other his quiver, we could not tell them
apart.24 This figure, equipped with both wings
and quiver, lies in the same position as the dying
Adonis in illustrated Ovids of the Renaissance,
so the dead shepherd may here be fused with the
sleeping boy, reminding us of the conclusion of
the tale.25 The allegorical significance of the
physical conflict is clear enough: eros versus
heros. But the painting offers no solution to the
conflict-its unity is strictly esthetic, achieved
through synthetic perspective, a masterful use of
color, and a balance of horizontals and verticals
accented by the single diagonal of the inter-
twined figures.

Titian's painting, then, can work as a narra-
tive, much as narratives can work as pictures.
He can imply narrative through the depiction of
attributes; through gesture, which is itself inter-
rupted action; and through the device of contin-
uous representation, in which the several scenes
of a painting depict successive events. He can
also use space as an equivalent to logical exten-
sion, so that the visual relationship of his figures
expresses their conceptual relationship. As each
figure is allegorized to become an abstraction, so
space is allegorized to become a visual syntax.26
The introduction of temporal and allegorical
sequence, though, threatens to fragment the vis-
ual realm of imitation. Pictorial success then
depends upon the artist's ability to control the
tension between visual and rhetorical schemes
through the unifying forces of three-dimensional
perspective and two-dimensional symmetry, in
order to create a "speaking picture," in which
the ocular unity of the scene brings a sense of
completeness to the story and argument.
In attaining its narrative unity, Shakespeare's
poem, like Titian's painting, seems to operate
through a reconciliation of tension, in which
visual images hold together the machinery of an
incomplete argumentative sequence. Shake-
speare's fundamental alteration of the myth, we
may recall, was to make Venus and Adonis
antagonists instead of lovers. Precisely what this
does is to place them physically in a tableau of
conflict and to transform this conflict of action
into a conflict of ideas, enacted in a formal de-
bate. Why does beauty wither? Venus argues
that Diana, goddess of chastity and narcissism,
is to blame and that love is the force that pre-
serves:

"And therefore hath [Diana] brib'd the
destinies
To cross the curious workmanship of
nature,
To mingle beauty with infirmities
And pure perfection with impure
defeature,
Making it subject to the tyranny
Of mad mischances and much
misery." (11. 733-38)

Adonis will have none of it. Venus he sees un-
equivocally as lust-not Venus Genetrix, but
Venus Vulgaris. Passion itself, then, is the force
of death:

"Call it not love, for love to heaven is fled,
Since sweating lust on earth usurp'd his name;
Under whose simple semblance he hath fed
Upon fresh beauty, blotting it with blame;
Which the hot tyrant stains and soon
bereaves,
As caterpillars do the tender leaves."
(11. 793-98)

The debate between Venus and Adonis per-
sistently resolves into the more traditional de-
bate between Venus and Diana, which, in as
immediate a source as Book III of the Faerie
Queene, represents warring attitudes toward sex-
ual love. Both goddesses are, in their way, hunt-
ers, though of different prey. Ovid tells how
Venus,

per silvas dumosaque saxa vagatur
fine genu vestem ritu succinta Dianae
hortaturque canes tutaeque animalia praedae,
aut pronos lepores aut celsum in cornua cervum
aut agitat dammas.
(Metamorphoses x.535-39)
over mountain ridges, through the woods, over
rocky places set with thorns, she ranges with her
garments girt up to her knees after the manner
of Diana. She also cheers on the hounds and
99
Shakespeare's Myth of Venus and Adonis
pursues those creatures which are safe to hunt,
such as the headlong hares, or the stag with
high-branching horns, or the timid doe.
Ovid lightly parodies the passage in Vergil's
Aeneid where Venus in the guise of Diana
helps Aeneas in his epic quest.27 The choice be-
tween the "hard hunt" for the boar and the "soft
hunt" for Wat the hare becomes a choice be-
tween the heroic and erotic lives, as Titian
knew.28
Venus tells us how in erotic mastery she sub-
dued the virile Mars:
"Thus he that overrul'd I oversway'd,
Leading him prisoner in a red rose chain:
Strong-temper'd steel his stronger strength
obey'd,
Yet was he servile to my coy disdain."
(11. 109-12)
If Mars here is robbed of heroism, one may re-
call that to the Neoplatonists the love of Mars
and Venus was an allegory of a transcendent
concordance of Virtue and Pleasure.29 Shake-
speare too crosses his debate structure with
images suggesting a reconciliation between eros
and heroism. Adonis' horse is an epic steed, fit
for the fields of praise; yet he is also a descend-
ant of Plato's dark horse, the emblem of li-
cense.30 The horse simultaneously breaks his
servile bondage and unbridles his lust:
The iron bit he crusheth 'tween his teeth,
Controlling what he was controlled with.
(11. 269-70)
Adonis too has been in bondage to Venus:
Look how a bird lies tangled in a net,
So fasten'd in her arms Adonis lies.
(11. 67-68)
Although Venus conquered Mars, Adonis has
conquered her, and has a chance to reenact his
horse's epic deed:
Now is she in the very lists of love,
Her champion mounted for the hot encounter.
All is imaginary she doth prove;
He will not manage her, although he mount her.
(11. 595-98)
The moment of union slips away, love's freedom
and bondage still at strife.
The debate structure of the poem permeates
not only individual symbols but the syntax of the
verse as well, so that images are yoked in war-
ring pairs. At the opening of the poem, red and
white appear as a smooth parallel: Adonis'
cheek is "more white and red than doves or
roses are" (1. 10). It is a familiar Petrarchist
trope for the complexion of the beloved, em-
bodying that blend of opposites which defines
beauty and linking this master-mistress with the
birds and flowers sacred to Venus.
As Adonis demurs, the conceit is inverted to
show his unreadiness for love: "He red for
shame, but frosty in desire" (1. 36). Syntacti-
cally the colors are now in opposition, yet
metaphorically they again express parallel sen-
timents-shame and disdain, both aspects of
pudor. When the figure is transferred to Venus
its tension is heightened, reflecting a clash of
emotions:
... the fighting conflict of her hue,
How white and red each other did destroy!
But now her cheek was pale, and by and by
It flash'd forth fire, as lightning from the sky.
(11. 345-48)
The figure then goes underground, only to
make two startling reappearances, one at the
first sight of the boar:
Whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red,
Like milk and blood being mingled both together.
(11. 901-02)
Syntactically the colors are in harmony, but, be-
cause of its position in the narrative, the conceit
is a torturous mockery, death in the garments of
love. Then the corpse of Adonis is transformed:
A purple flower sprung up, checker'd with
white,
Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood
Which in round drops upon their whiteness
stood. (11. 1168-70)
In the dozens of versions of
cal and Renaissance verse a
else is the flower both red
Adonis is turned to a ros
anemone, and some record that the flower for-
merly was white but now is stained red with the
shepherd's blood. Shakespeare's insistence is
clear, recalling the antithesis one last time, re-
stored nearly to its original form but applied
now to an object that is the negation of the
original-a summation of the struggle among
Venus, Adonis, and the boar.

S. Clark Hulse
The war of red flame and pale frost is echoed
by the more elementary strife of fire and water.
Ovid, at the opening of the Metamorphoses, tells
how an unknown god bound in harmony the
warring elements.31 Natali Conti, meditating on
a passage in Euripides, discovers that Harmony
is "the offspring of the elements of all things;
and that force which is born from the motion of
celestial bodies, whether we call it divine or
natural, acting so that the elements themselves
are led into this mixture, or rather leading them,
that force is called Venus."32 Shakespeare's
Venus strives to harmonize the elements, as they
appear in various guises: in climatic terms, they
are wind, sun, earth, and rain; in emotional
terms, sighs, desires, disdain, and tears. As
Aphrodite, foam-born, she is already hot and
moist (Giraldi, p. 372):
"My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow
burning.
My smooth moist hand, were it with thy
hand felt,
Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to
melt." (11. 142-44)
While love is, as she tells us, all fire (1. 149),
the excess of burning passion will "set the heart
on fire" (1. 388) and must be cooled with tears.
The hot and dry of fire oppose the cold and
moist of water, so that between the two elements
there can be either chaotic strife or creative
union. In the balance of these elements, as
Adonis points out, lies the distinction between
sweet love and sour lust:
"Love comforteth like sunshine after rain,
But lust's effect is tempest after sun;
Love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain,
Lust's winter comes ere summer half be done."
(11. 799-802)
The union of Mars and Venus is precisely the
harmonious blending of heat and moisture
(Sabinus, p. 143). Venus seeks such a union
with Adonis, but he is cold and dry, with his
eyes and passions fixed on earth (11. 118, 340),
and he can only intermittently supply either heat
or moisture:
Panting he lies and breatheth on her face.
She feedeth on the steam as on a prey,
And calls it heavenly moisture. (11. 62-64)
He sees her coming, and begins to glow,
Even as a dying coal revives with wind.
(11. 337-38)
Adonis spoke sound doctrine concerning the
elements but refuses the act of temperance of
which Shakespeare wrote in his Anacreontic
sonnets (Nos. 153-54): to cool his torch in her
fountain. The strife of elements with which
Venus is left makes her subject to a chaos within,
the very tempest that Adonis predicted. Her
grief at his loss is an earthquake of wind strug-
gling with earth (11. 1046-47), and she threat-
ens finally to consume herself in a reaction of
air, earth, fire, and water that seems like a re-
verse alchemy:
"My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone;
Mine eyes are turn'd to fire, my heart to lead.
Heavy heart's lead melt at mine eyes' red
fire!
So shall I die by drops of hot desire."
(11. 1071-74)
The struggle to harmonize the elements, as
Pico believed, was the struggle for the discordia
concordans that sustains love and beauty.33 The
inability of Venus to overcome that strife fore-
shadows the tragic ending of the poem. The
debate structure, operating in individual lines
and images as well as in the central action of the
poem, becomes a syntactic principle that pre-
pares us for a resolution, in which the unity of
the poem would reside in the simultaneous
closure of plot and argument. The ending of the
poem, indeed, is cast as an etiology, appropriate
for the conclusion of a rationalized myth:
"For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,
And beauty dead, black Chaos comes again."
(11. 1019-20)
"Since thou art dead, lo here I prophesy,
Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend:
It shall be waited on with jealousy,
Find sweet beginning, but unsavoury end."
(11. 1135-38)
Precisely at the point where we expect logical
conclusion, though, the syntax of plot and ar-
gument breaks down, for the etiology is false.
Black Chaos is already loose in the world in
Cynthia's jealousy, in the bristling boar, and in
Venus' own passions, which from their sweet
beginning were full of gluttony, jealousy, wrath,
and anguish. Shakespeare has stretched the
101
Shakespeare's Myth of Venus and Adonis
sinews of prolepsis, for the action of the poem is
as much a result as a cause of its conclusion. As
if that were not enough, Shakespeare adds a sec-
ond conclusion, which demonstrates the oppo-
site point about love. From the blood of Adonis
springs a flower, which Venus plucks: so Venus
remains faithful to Adonis, and the two are, fi-
nally, fruitful:
"Here was thy father's bed, here in my breast;
Thou art the next of blood, and 'tis thy right.
Lo in this hollow cradle take thy rest;
My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night:
There shall not be one minute in an hour
Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love's flower."
(11. 1183-88)
The debate between Venus and Adonis is
never resolved. A series of metaphors mediates
between them, each of which generates the same
antithesis. Love is life and death, harmony and
chaos, bliss and agony, beauty and horror-the
paradoxes teeter out of sight on the even feet of
oxymoron:
"Ne'er settled equally, but high or low,
That all love's pleasure shall not match his woe."
(11. 1139-40)
The tension of paradox, though, is constantly
released by the shifting structures of the poem:
by its proleptic narrative, by its double ending.
The terms of the debate slide from one set of
images to another, joined at innumerable points.
The conflict moves from syllogisms to proverbs,
to goddesses, to horses and rabbits, to colors
and elements. With each set of terms, an ab-
stract dualism is momentarily balanced in a
sensible image, generating a kind of "insight," or
brief resolution, for, as E. H. Gombrich ob-
serves, "the sense of sight provides an analogue
to the non-discursive mode of apprehension
which must travel from multiplicity to unity."34
In that pattern of tension and release, of the
recurrent dualism momentarily resolved in an
image, lies the experience of cohesion that gives
unity to the poem.
III. Shakespearean Paradox
Shakespeare's literary myth comes surpris-
ingly close to the function that Levi-Strauss sug-
gested for primary myth: to bridge the gap
between conflicting values through "a series of
mediating devices, each of which generates the
next one by a process of opposition and correla-
tion. ... The kind of logic in mythical thought is
as rigorous as that of modem science ... the dif-
ference lies, not in the quality of the intellectual
process, but in the nature of the things to which
it is applied" (pp. 226, 230). Just as primary
myth may be an alternative form of logical rea-
soning indulged in by whole societies, Shake-
speare's manner of paradox making has the
characteristics of a persistent personal syntax.
Indeed, if we once again think of myth as a
conceptual form rather than as a content, we
might call it Shakespeare's personal myth, a way
of perceiving and reconciling the paradoxes of
experience.
Venus and Adonis has been compared to the
sonnets, the early comedies, even the tragedies.
In its handling of paradox, it most closely re-
sembles the mature comedies, or even a problem
comedy. What makes a problem comedy prob-
lematic is the realization that the tension be-
tween opposed values is a permanent condition
of life.35 In Measure for Measure, Angelo and
Escalus enter into a formal debate between Jus-
tice and Mercy in Act ii, but the conflict disap-
pears in the final sentencing of all the characters
to marriage. High comedy conceals similar diffi-
culties, for its argument, as Northrop Frye tells
us, is individual fulfillment and social harmony
-admirable values both, but perhaps less easily
reconciled than Frye's formula would admit.36
As You Like It is obviously a play working
toward both values, and its ending brings them
into a theatrical balance through the simple
technique of a double ending. First Hymen, the
embodiment of social harmony, links each cou-
ple; then Jaques, the soul of humorous indi-
vidualism, repeats Hymen's action and nearly
his very words, giving to each the fulfillment of
his ambition.
Two insightful critics of Shakespeare, Nor-
man Rabkin and Stephen Booth, have examined
this obsessive paradox making. In Hamlet, Rab-
kin finds, "Shakespeare tends to structure his
imitations in terms of a pair of polar opposites,"
between which we must, but cannot, choose (p.
12). Examining the sonnets, Booth finds the
reverse-that one set of opposites is incom-

mensurate with another-that syntactic paradox
leads us one way, imagistic paradox another,
prosodic a third, with no release of the tension
created.37 Venus and Adonis offers us, I think,
something between the two models: by shifting,
in the manner described by Booth, from one set
of terms-one whole structure-to another, a
release from paradox is achieved. The style of
Venus and Adonis might best be epitomized in
the metaphors of red and white: a constant shift-
ing of the significance of the images and of the
syntactic structures linking them, which are held
together as a series simply by the repetition of
the image itself.
As Rabkin observes, though, the reconcilia-
tion "cannot be reduced to prose paraphrase or
statements of theme because the kind of 'state-
ment' a given play makes cannot respectably be
made in the logical language of prose" (p. 12).
For a work like Venus and Adonis, where the
serial form of narrative encourages the serial
form of logical discourse, the achievement of a
purely esthetic resolution is particularly fine. It
is done by shifting out of the dialogue of argu-
ment into a discourse of images-iconography
-thus opening the possibility of an iconic reso-
lution of the same sort that Shakespeare habitu-
ally achieved on the stage through the visual
image of coupling. Paradox, then, is too neat a
word; it suggests a final, balanced position, the
seeming opposition overcome. Shakespearean
paradox, in Venus and Adonis at least, is a
problem, not of seeing or seeming, but of being.
Erotic experience can be described only by
combining two ways of thinking, the discursive
and the iconic, and shuttling from one to the
other when the variety of that experience can be
described in no other words and the unity re-
called in no other way.
