                This thesis offers a study of Shakespeare’s Venus and Adonis (and by extension Lucrece)
                that builds on Ted Hughes’s claim that they function as two halves of a binary whole.
                1 Tracing a
                contrapuntal surface symmetry between the poems, Hughes argues that Venus and Adonis
                encodes the founding myth of Catholicism and Lucrece that of Puritanism; the poems together
                convey the great metaphysical war between these two oppositional forces that so haunted
                Elizabethan England.
                2 Critics have dismissed Shakespeare’s mythological references as mere
                “poet’s argot,” yet I shall build on Hughes’s reading of this ‘argot’ as “a sacred symbolic
                language in itself” to show how Venus and Adonis embodies a coherent system of signification
                that encrypts the archetypal conflict, not ultimately between Protestantism and Catholicism, but
                rather between two diametrically opposed hermeneutical tendencies: on the side of Venus, that of
                the broadly ‘Gnostic’ (the highly syncretic, ever-allegorizing, esoteric knowledge-seeking)
                tradition; and on the side of Adonis, that of the broadly ‘Puritan’ (the rigidly dogmatic,
                Protestant Biblical literalist) tradition.3

INTRODUCTION
First published in 1593, William Shakespeare’s Venus and Adonis is an early modern
epyllion4 based on the ancient fable enshrined in Ovid’s Metamorphoses.
5
In Ovid’s version,
which is far shorter than Shakespeare’s, Venus, celestial goddess of love, woos Adonis,
seasonal-vegetation god of ever-youthful beauty, who requites her love. Despite her
protestations, he then goes off to hunt a boar who slays him. While the fable inspired many poets
to render it in their own ways, Shakespeare’s rendition is exceptional for the alteration he makes
to it. Until Shakespeare set his pen to the mythic material, every version of the fable had Adonis
reciprocate Venus’s romantic solicitations. As S. Clark Hulse writes, “Shakespeare’s
fundamental alteration of the myth . . . was to make Venus and Adonis antagonists instead of
lovers. Precisely what this does is to place them physically in a tableau of conflict and to
transform this conflict of action into a conflict of ideas, enacted in a formal debate.”
6
By rendering the ever-youthful beauty that is Adonis a reticent interlocutor who rejects
the very goddess of love, and by giving Venus the role of voluble rhetorician who solicits her
repressor to no avail, Shakespeare forges a conflict between two irreconcilable tendencies which
are, on the surface, most obviously understood in the crude terms of, in Adonis’s case, chastity,
and in Venus’s case, lust. But building on Hulse’s observation that Shakespeare transforms the
original conflict of the Venus and Adonis fable “into a conflict of ideas, enacted in a formal
debate,” this thesis will read the poem’s antithetical structure forged between Venus and Adonis
allegorically in terms of a conflict between two diametrically opposed hermeneutical tendencies.

I shall call the syncretic Venus tendency ‘Gnostic’ and the recalcitrant Adonis tendency
‘Puritanical’ for reasons explained below.
Fittingly, as might be expected by the poem’s antithetical structure, criticism on Venus
and Adonis has tended to divide itself between: i) simplistic allegorical and/or moralistic
readings (which sympathize with the chaste Adonis),7
and ii) purely erotic, comic, and/or
aesthetic readings (which abject allegorical/moralistic readings and celebrate Venus’s liberating
eroticism).8 Occupying the middle ground are iii) readings which see the poem as intentionally
ambivalent (and which celebrate its valorization of irresolvable oppositions).
9 Lu Emily Pearson,
herself in the first camp, writes that the “teaching of Venus and Adonis is as didactic a piece of
work, perhaps, as Shakespeare ever wrote.”10 She takes the figures at face-value almost to the
same extent as the eroticists do: for her, Adonis embodies rational holy love and Venus predatory
sensual love, so that “when Adonis is killed beauty is killed, and the world is left in black
chaos.”11 T. W. Baldwin, perhaps too intimately familiar with Neoplatonism, similarly claims
that Adonis is simply “Love and Beauty,” and that “when he dies Chaos is come again.”12 Robert
P. Miller, who will read Venus and Adonis as a “Christian Mythological Narrative,”13 takes
Venus at face-value as an embodiment of lust when he writes,

According to Renaissance morality . . . love-making which stresses intercourse for
the sake of pleasure only is artificial, a perversion of nature because a misuse of
natural functions. This love falls into the old confusion of utendum and fruendum,
use and abuse—a confusion that lies behind much of the persuasive philosophy of
the goddess of love throughout Venus and Adonis.
14
In similar fashion, W. R. Streitberger,
15 Franklin M. Dickey,16 and Don Cameron Allen17 take the
poem at face-value, as it were, and inveigh against Venus but not the poet. Norman Rabkin
distinguishes himself from these critics by reserving his indignation for the Venus we are
introduced to at the beginning of the poem: the one she becomes is, for him, a moral
improvement of the Neoplatonic variety.18 The poem, said by Gabriel Harvey to please the
“younger sort,”19 is for these critics the one to make the younger sort moral. These critics
perceive the poem’s allegorical dimension, but their interpretations, however steeped in
Neoplatonic doctrine, fail to account for Venus’s ambivalent, shifting nature and the poem’s
juxtaposition between i) the way she is ‘read’ by Adonis (the way she manifests in Adonis’s
perceptual field) and ii) the way he is ‘read’ by her (the way he manifests in her perceptual field).

In the second camp, Rufus Putney would have us isolate the poem’s comic dimension, to
the extent of neglecting even its erotic one.20 Contrary to the first camp, Putney perceives Adonis
to be “distinctly secondary to Venus and only occasionally appealing.”21 For him, Adonis “is
rendered comic by the obtuse view he takes of the passion he has inspired in the goddess, but
even more by his petulance and self-pity.”22 Putney, to a limited extent, senses the poet’s
allegiance to Venus, and anatomizes the poem’s comic dimension for us, but denies its erotic and
mythic dimensions to the reader’s detriment. Though ultimately occupying the middle ground,
Kenneth Muir aligns himself with this second camp when he praises the poem’s “daring
sensuality”23 and maintains that Shakespeare dramatizes Venus’s seduction of Adonis as a means
of countering “the effects of Renaissance painting, and of repudiating the denials of the flesh by
puritan moralists and Neoplatonic theorists.”24 Tita French Baumlin, herself in the second camp,
writes:
Certainly, in terms of the entire poem’s erotic language, continually an aspect of
the poet’s art which readers have often appreciated, there appears an attempt to
equal and even exceed Ovid’s own mastery of lush, sensuous language. Flesh is a
central concern in the poem, particularly its moistness, its texture.25
Such critics perceive the poet’s allegiance with Venus as well as the poem’s repudiation of
“puritan moralists,” but they overemphasize the poem’s erotic surface to the neglect of its

allegorical dimension.26 The more balanced Edward Dowden praises with impassioned
enthusiasm Shakespeare’s ability to remain “unimpassioned” while coolly canvassing the
physical in Venus and Adonis.
27 Somewhat in line with Dowden, Maurice Evans notes that the
“revival of Platonism in particular had created a new pressure to idealize sexual love and to
deplore its animal qualities or at least to make them respectable.”28 Less balanced, but also in
line with the poem’s repudiation of puritan moralists, Muriel Bradbrook praises the poem as a
“justification of the natural and instinctive beauty of the animal world against sour moralists and
scurrilous invective, a raising of the animal mask to sentient level, the emancipation of the
flesh.”29 Even more heavy-handed, and perhaps even more consistent with the anti-puritanical
structure I propose, is Bruce Smith’s homoerotic reading. For him, the poem possesses “an erotic
allure” for pubescent boys “far stronger than that of heroes or heroines whose gender is
certain.”30 He fashions Adonis a Leander, a Hermaphroditus, who “inspire[s] in other men,
especially older men, a desire to initiate the youths into maleness, to incorporate them,
physically, into the male power structure.”31 Also in this camp, Gordon Williams focuses on the
“sexual jealousy” of the “Vamp” that is Venus and the “sexual awakening” of Adonis.

Jonathan Bate focuses on the poem’s “Sexual Perversity.”33 Richard Halpern and Chantelle
Thauvette will even read the poem as “a piece of softcore pornography.”34 None of these
readings are invalid; they simply overemphasize one dimension of the poem (its most obvious
one) to the neglect of others.
Occupying the ‘intentional ambivalence’ middle ground, Muir35 and David Bevington,36
though aligning themselves to varying degrees with one or the other camp, see straightforward
attempts at providing closure unsatisfying. Rather than seeking to resolve its ambiguities, they
praise the poem for its valorization of irresolvable oppositions. In “Venus and Adonis: Comedy
or Tragedy?” Muir writes,
Although an interpretation that seeks to show that Shakespeare was writing a
sermon against lust is clearly impossible, it is equally impossible to assume that
the poem is a straightforward eulogy of sexual love. Almost everything in the
poem appears to be ambivalent. The famous description of Adonis’s stallion
pursuing the mare can be taken either as an emblem of the naturalness of desire,
as Venus herself points out, or as an emblem of uncontrolled desire, or lust, as it
frequently was.37

While aligned with the ‘moralistic’ subset of the first camp, Streitberger’s reading reflects a
sensitivity to the poem’s ostensibly disparate dimensions. He writes that while Shakespeare
“manages to retain the erotic tone of the genre, he presents on another level an essentially moral
struggle, one which his sophisticated readers were unlikely to miss.”38 And yet his moralist
reading takes Venus at face-value as a “moral threat to Adonis” who attempts to “persuade him
from the noble to the easy hunt,” that she might “destroy his virtues and make him an unfit
gentleman.”39 While Streitberger’s reading acknowledges the poem’s myriad dimensions, so
straightforward a conclusion, I will argue, fails to adequately take into account the competing
perspectives (the competing reading methods) represented, respectively, by Venus and Adonis,
and the way in which the diametrically opposed epistemologies associated with these two
mutually exclusive hermeneutical tendencies clash throughout the poem. A. C. Hamilton comes
still closer to capturing the poem’s ostensibly disparate dimensions when he writes that its
“juxtaposition of flesh and spirit is too deliberate, too much part of the poem’s wit to be
cancelled out by any reduction of Venus to a moral description as lust opposed to love,”40 adding
that the “union in Venus of the ‘marrow burning’ and the ‘spirit all compact of fire’ is essential
to the poem’s argument.”41 He comes close to perceiving the narrator’s allegiance to Venus but
ultimately concludes that our response to her “must be ambivalent.”42 In sum, Muir, Bevington,
and Hamilton perceive the poem’s ambivalences and, though aligning themselves to varying
degrees with one or the other camp, ultimately pose a devastating challenge to straightforward

attempts i) on the part of the first camp to reduce the poem to a simplistic moralistic or
Neoplatonic lesson, and ii) on the part of the second camp to reduce the poem to its comic or
erotic dimension. But they satisfy themselves with an unsatisfying conclusion. They neglect to
see the poem’s consistently reinforced antithetical structure in terms of a conflict between two
diametrically opposed hermeneutical tendencies. As I will argue, Adonis consistently ‘reads’
Venus in a manner expressive of a hermeneutical tendency which is antithetical to the
hermeneutical tendency expressed by Venus’s manner of reading Adonis. I submit that this
consistently reinforced antithetical structure between the way in which the two characters read
one another (and the consistently reinforced clash of mutually exclusive epistemologies with
which this radical distinction in hermeneutical tendency is inextricable) best explains the poem’s
ostensibly irresolvable ambivalences which manifest themselves so clearly in the poem’s critical
divide.
For critics who have contrasted Shakespeare with Spenser, the latter employs
Neoplatonic allegory seriously, while the former only employs it to parody or subvert it. For
example, opposing herself to Pearson, Ellen April Harwood perceives that while “[s]uch critics
[as Pearson] treat Venus as a figure much like Acrasia and assume that Shakespeare views her as
Spenser does the mistress of the Bower,” the “narrator of Shakespeare’s poem pities Venus’s
plight.”43 Not only this, but “his sympathy for her increases as the poem progresses.”44 Thus,
while taking Venus’s initial role as “impertinent aggressor” at face-value, rather than as a
consequence of how Adonis ‘reads’ her (which is itself, I will argue, a more compelling reading),
Harwood goes on to observe that, even if the narrator so “regards her at first,” he “soon sees her

the University of Rutgers Libraries, Vol. 39, No. 1 (1977), 57.

Jennings 9
as Adonis’s victim.”45 However, Harwood writes that Shakespeare “adopts Neo-platonic
philosophy, as Ovid would, in order to mock mystery.”46 She pithily captures how the poet has
Adonis mistake “a traditional emblem of lust [the boar] for love,” but concludes it is the poet
himself who “shatters the Neo-platonic vision of the one.”
47 Contrary to Harwood, I will argue
that the goddess of love manifests as she does as a consequence of the way in which Adonis
‘reads’ her. His reading of her is a ‘misreading’ according to the opposing hermeneutical
tendency, with which, I will argue, Venus and the poet are aligned. I will argue that it is not the
poet himself (as Harwood would have it), but rather this ‘misreading’ of Adonis’s that “shatters
the Neo-platonic vision of the one”48—this ‘misreading’ of Adonis’s that precludes the great
consummation between Love and Beauty.
Consistent with my reading that the poem places the blame (for the unconsummated
Neoplatonic union) on the repressive Adonis rather than on either an impertinent Venus or (selfreflexively) on a Neoplatonism-subverting narrator, Coppélia Kahn interprets Adonis’s
“narcissism” to be the problem, but she restricts her interpretation to its psychoanalytic
application.49 Even more to the point (of seeing the poem as holding Adonis, rather than Venus,
culpable for the unconsummated Neoplatonic union), Nona Fienberg’s feminist reading sees
Venus as using “the very rhetorical tools of the patriarchy to subvert its fixed values.”50
According to my reading, it is Adonis’s fixed patriarchal values that are the great obstacle to the
Neoplatonic union, and it is Venus who is using the patriarchal system’s very own language to

Jennings 10
subvert its fixed values. Fienberg will, for example, write of lines 547-558 that the “complex
mixture of sexual and political language in these stanzas suggests [Venus’s] subversion of
patriarchy through parody,”51 but she restricts her reading to the poem’s political and socioeconomic dimensions, to the neglect of its mythic layers.
More recently, Anne Lake Prescott has referred to “our time’s frequently expressed antiallegorical bias.”52 She cites Anthony Mortimer’s “distaste for the ‘solemnities of allegory,’” and
observes he has “plenty of company.”53 She defends allegory by noting that “in the right hands”
it can “be witty as well as morally astute, just as can an anti-allegory that evokes its conventional
other.”54 She suggests that “[i]n readings of Renaissance texts . . . the equation of allegoresis
with moralism or political acquiescence may be a modern prejudice.”55 Of the original fable’s
potentialities she writes the following:
in 1586, William Charke reported in an anti-papist tract that at one time in
Orleans an image of Venus lamenting the death of Adonis was venerated by the
superstitious in the belief that it showed the Virgin Mary with her dead son, and
George Buchanan’s life of Mary Stuart recounts the death of Darnley but then
scoffingly, if not altogether logically, calls Bothwell the murderous queen’s ‘faire
Adonis.’ Shakespeare was not alone in seeing the story’s comic and ironic
possibilities.56

Her defense of allegoresis in these ‘prejudicial times’ of ours helps correct the false impression
which (according to her) “plenty” of critics have of its potential to yield fruitful readings.
Moreover, this confirmation of the original fable’s “comic and ironic possibilities” helps clarify
the mythic potentialities latent in the material to which Shakespeare set his pen. But Prescott
restricts her allegorical reading to the poet’s exploitation of the original fable as a seasonalvegetation myth as well as an “explicitly calendrical and astronomical or astrological” one.57 Her
exploration of these layers of the poem gives further confirmation for its concealment of a
“meaning denied to the common reader,”58 as Christopher Butler and Alastair Fowler put it, and
her findings are consistent with the antithetical structure I propose: by unveiling, as it were, this
sophisticated “astronomical or astrological” layer of the poem, Prescott (building on the work of
Butler and Fowler) shows that the poem’s ostensible discrepancy between its purely naturalistic
surface and its mythic sub-surface lends itself to the two diametrically opposed hermeneutical
tendencies which, according to my reading, are represented, respectively, by the poem’s two
characters. However, while she does push her analysis into the metaphysical terrain of astrology,
she still restricts her allegorical reading to the more ‘naturalistic’ layers of its mythic dimension
(its seasonal-vegetative/astronomical layers). Moreover, without availing herself of the
antithetical structure which I propose (one forged between two diametrically opposed
hermeneutical tendencies), she is ultimately unable to clarify how the poem’s ostensibly
disparate dimensions might be profitably reconciled with one another.

As can be seen, the poem has given rise to a series of mutually exclusive readings (or a
series of readings that would at least appear to be mutually exclusive). Among the allegorists,
there is much talk of Neoplatonism, and among the eroticists, psychoanalysts, and feminists
much talk about puritan moralists and subversion of the patriarchy, but little if any clarification
of the poem’s antithetical structure forged between two diametrically opposed hermeneutical
tendencies. In Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being, Ted Hughes, writing in his
capacity as a poet rather than as a scholar, perceives this ‘thesis-antithesis’ structure in Venus
and Adonis and uses the word “Puritanical” (in highly ahistorical and anachronistic ways, as well
as in a neglectfully unqualified manner) to refer to the poem’s antithesis (what I am calling the
hermeneutical tendency represented by Adonis). Hughes does not consistently apply a single
word to the poem’s thesis (what I am calling the hermeneutical tendency represented by Venus
and the poet), but, for Hughes, this side of the antithetical structure is associated with what he
calls “Hermetic Occult Neoplatonism,” “Christian Cabalism,” “Gnosticism,” the “mystery
schools,” the “secret societies,” and pre-Catholic pagan worship of the “perennial Goddess”
(and, to a much lesser extent, Catholic preservation of the “perennial Goddess” in the severely
stifled form that is the Catholic Mary).59 Hughes does not frame the poem’s antithetical structure
in terms of tendencies. Rather, he simplistically refers to Venus’s side as that of the “perennial
Goddess” and to Adonis’s side as that of the “Puritanical Goddess-repressing god.”60 For
Hughes, the poem offers a broadly Esoteric (Hermetic, Neoplatonic, Christian Cabalistic,
Gnostic, etc.) account of what he calls the Puritanical error. The Puritanical error is to be
understood as the Puritan’s erroneous anathematization of the invisible world of the unconscious

Jennings 13
(of which the libido is a crucial subset), and the Puritan’s consequent eschewal of the esoteric
wisdom that is to be acquired through engagement with it. For Hughes, the Goddess is properly
understood as an embodiment of this invisible world and, by extension, the esoteric wisdom that
is to be obtained through this broadly ‘Gnostic’ (esoteric knowledge-seeking) engagement with
it. Adonis, who microcosmically embodies man (quite literally, male humanity),
61 is, for the
opposing hermeneutical tendency, a potential god; his rejection of the Goddess is his rejection of
the esoteric knowledge whereby he might realize his divinity in the here and now. By
‘Puritanically’ repressing the Goddess, and by anathematizing her into the infernal, animalistic
boar (a form in which she may be hunted, rather than ‘penetrated’), Adonis ends up being slain
by its re-emergence into his consciousness in the infernal, animalistic form to which his
‘Puritanical misperception’ has reduced it.
Adonis’s Phoenician name functions as a play on the Hebrew ‘Adonai,’ the Lord of the
Bible. Adonis also inherits a mythic tradition which holds him to be a ‘sun god,’ a title which
functions as a play on the Christian ‘Son of God.’ For Hughes, the poet exploits these puns and
Adonis’s man-god status,62 as well as the mythographer’s syncretic interpretation of i) Adonis as
an early incarnation of Christ in the world’s great cycle of myths and of ii) Venus (and Mary) as

Not only is the word true to the limitations of the pertinent historical writers but it also pithily
captures the fact that Adonis represents not only humanity but specifically male humanity in
contradistinction to Venus who represents not only divinity but specifically female divinity. As
Puritanism is patriarchal, the Puritan deifies Man but not Woman, and it is this patriarchal Mandeifying Puritan whom (on this reading) the female divinity Venus strives to illuminate through

most pertinent incarnation is the Gnostic Sophia)63 to capture the debate between the broadly
‘Gnostic’ tradition and ‘Puritanism’ in the character’s very being. In Adonis’s own ‘Puritanical’
eyes, man is not a potential Christ; rather, Christ is God, whom he is to worship.64 In the eyes of
the Goddess, who embodies the broadly ‘Gnostic’ tradition, Christ is not the God who created
man, but rather a God (a divine state of being) into whom (into which) man might transform
himself (through cultivation of occult power via acquisition of esoteric knowledge).65 For her,
then, Adonis is a potential Christ, whose misconception of what he and Christ are precludes his
access to the divinity it his birthright to realize.66 In sum, on Hughes’s reading, the poem is to be
understood as cryptically dramatizing—preserving through concealment the key that unlocks the
secret to—the archetypal conflict between the i) perennial Goddess of the broadly ‘Gnostic’
tradition, whose most pertinent ‘incarnation’ is the Gnostic Sophia—and one of whose many
‘incarnations’ is the Mary of Catholicism (her most stifled, least ‘Gnostic’ one)67—and the ii)
Puritanical Goddess-repressing god.68
While, on Hughes’s reading, the many different myths of the perennial Goddess are all
pertinent, it is the Gnostic Sophia myth that cuts to the heart of the conflict between the i) wicked

Demiurge Jaldabaoth (with which the Gnostic identifies the God of the Hebrew Bible, whom the
Puritanical Adonis worships and, in another sense, has become) and the ii) Goddess Sophia who
has fallen from the center of the heavenly heights and accidentally given birth to the Demiurge in
whose creation she has become imprisoned. In the Gnostic myth, Sophia (the Wisdom of God)
seeks to know God objectively when he is in fact (paradoxically) purely subjective. Through this
striving for objective knowledge, she gives birth to an illusory conception of God, which morphs
into the quite real Jaldabaoth. This Jaldabaoth, an illusory conception of God, vainly pretends to
be the one true God. Sophia (like Venus) is a representative of the esoteric wisdom which the
Jaldabaoth Demiurge (the Puritanical Adonis) anathematizes. As in the Gnostic Sophia myth, the
key to the fallen Goddess’s salvation is the “Aeon Jesus” latent in Adonis, and so is the key to
his own. This “Aeon Jesus” is the Goddess’s Sacred Bridegroom, who was her other half in the
very beginning of things. As in the Gnostic Sophia myth, this lesser, illusory deity Jaldabaoth
(Jehovah, whom the Puritanical Adonis worships) obfuscates the Puritan’s true origins to grant
himself ultimate authority as the Almighty God. According to the Gnostic, Adonis has fallen
prey to this Jehovan deception: he has been fooled into denying himself the real deity latent
within him. It is with this deity (the “Aeon Jesus”) which the fallen Goddess is to be reunited, so
that the two may return, in matrimonial union, to their divine home. It is Adonis’s Puritanical
error (his rejection of the Goddess as a diabolical whore, into which Biblical literalism reduces
her) that precludes this consummation.69
Throughout his introduction, Hughes (again, writing in his capacity as a poet rather than
as a scholar) gives crude summaries of historical events. According to Hughes, this encryption
method allows the poem to, on one level, function as a commendation of the Protestant Adonis

for rejecting the Great Whore of Babylon (which the Geneva Bible marginalia identifies as the
Roman Catholic Church)70 and on a deeper level function as a broadly ‘Gnostic’ (Esoteric
wisdom tradition) account of Puritanism (roughly speaking, a more serious subset of
Protestantism).
71 This would have allowed it to circumvent the morally severe Protestant censor
John Whitgift and the anti-Catholic Protestant multitudes he would have represented.72 As
Hughes puts it in his crude, anachronistic way, the ‘Puritanical’ force of fundamentalist
Christianity snuffed the Gnostic Sophia out in the early centuries A.D. and drove her
underground where she has been forced to remain in the elusive form of mystery schools and
secret societies up to this very day.73 The Goddess (the invisible world of the unconscious, of
which the libido is a crucial subset), who has been completely eradicated from the ‘Puritanical’
worldview, just barely survived Christianity in the severely stifled, paradoxically anti-‘Gnostic’
form of the Catholic Mary.74 According to Hughes, the Goddess has three aspects: her heavenly
virginal one, her earthly sacred bride one, and her infernal one. For him, the travesty that is
Catholicism preserves alone the heavenly virginal aspect of the Goddess to the neglect of her
other two. She is therefore a kind of sham Goddess (just as the Biblical Jesus is, for the Gnostic,
a sham Christ).

Hughes infers Shakespeare to be Catholic, but ultimately argues that, in the poem, the
Goddess’s Catholic veil is simply another veil beneath her Venal one.75 Here he equivocates
between his own syncretic interpretation of myth and what he infers to be Shakespeare’s
Catholic beliefs. That is, on one hand he holds the Goddess instantiated in Mary to precede her
Marian incarnation in the world’s great cycle of myths, while on the other hand he holds
Shakespeare to have been a crypto-Catholic. What he ends up doing is making Shakespeare view
the Goddess as he (Hughes) views the Goddess while somehow retaining traditional Catholic
doctrines such as a belief in eternal hellfire.76 Hughes also writes a good deal about “Hermetic
Occult Neoplatonism” in his introduction, but without sufficiently clarifying the precise extent to
which it plays a role in the poem Venus and Adonis. He writes about the Gnostic myth of Sophia
and relates it in some detail to such plays as Cymbeline, Pericles, and The Winter’s Tale,
77 and in
great detail to The Tempest,
78 but in little detail to Venus and Adonis.
79 Focusing his attention on
what he calls the poem’s “fixed” allegorical dimension, he also neglects to do the close readings
of what he calls the poem’s “free” particulars (while acknowledging this neglect), where the
“free” particulars are to be understood as the specific, naturalistic, embodied dramatizations, and,
as it were, the gory, sweaty instantiations of the abstract universals of the poem’s “fixed”
allegorical dimension.80 Notwithstanding these serious confusions and omissions, Hughes’s
central insight, when clarified, qualified, refined, and actually substantiated through the close
readings he neglected to do, may offer a useful framework through which to think about the

antithetical structure of the poem which has variously eluded, polarized, and bewildered critics
since 1593.81
Building on Hughes’s central insight, I will argue that the poem’s antithetical structure is
to be understood in the archetypal terms of two diametrically opposed hermeneutical tendencies
(which I shall call ‘Gnostic’ and ‘Puritanical,’ respectively), rather than as a conflict to be
restricted to two clearly definable, historically contingent systems of thought. Nevertheless, late
sixteenth-century England (while endlessly complicated in terms of doctrinal nuance between
and amongst individual sects) may be understood, in very broad terms, to be characterized by
these two diametrically opposed hermeneutical tendencies. In The Alternative Trinity: Gnostic
Heresy in Marlowe, Milton, and Blake, A. D. Nuttall writes of the “simultaneous rise” in the
early modern period of
two contradictory pictures of human nature: from magicians, Platonists, and
Hermetists came the idea that human potential was limitless: man could ascend
into the firmament of knowledge and become divine; from Calvin and the
Reformers came the contrary idea that human capacity was zero: man is totally
depraved, naturally damned, deprived of all initiative, whether for moral or
intellectual good. Each of these ideas is moving rapidly in the sixteenth century.
Each is on a collision course with the other. What better place for their encounter
than the stage of the Rose Theatre?82

81 See Kolin, Introduction.
82 Nuttall, The Alternative Trinity, 25.
Jennings 19
And when the theatres close down due to a plague, as they did in January of 1593, what better
place for this “encounter,” one might ask, than the leaves of Venus and Adonis? Nuttall goes on
to write that
Calvin notoriously denied human free will through his doctrine of predestination. At
the same time he retained the notion that man, for all that he could do nothing but sin,
was nevertheless responsible for that sin and justly damnable. The PlatonicoHermetical party of the other hand ascribed to man not just free will but also a kind
of super-freedom, a liberty to determine one’s own nature: a doctrine which curiously
anticipates twentieth-century Existentialism.83
While I would not necessarily argue that Adonis’s viewpoint should be restricted to Calvinism,
this formulation of Nuttall’s is helpful in clarifying the antithetical structure which is, in my
reading, forged between Venus and Adonis. There is no single word which adequately captures
either hermeneutical tendency, and there is no one historical movement or system of thought to
which either tendency may be restricted. But broadly speaking, the one hermeneutical tendency,
that of Venus, is the ever-malleable, ever-open, ever-allegorizing, ever-reconciliatory, nondoctrinal tendency exemplified, for instance, by the early modern syncretist who, inspired by the
alchemical process of synthesizing ostensibly mutually exclusive antitheses, subscribed to a
confluence of such systems of thought as Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, Hermeticism, Cabalism,
and Christianity. Such syncretists who exemplify this tendency take elements of these many
ostensibly disparate systems of thought and reject those less amenable to syncretization. Along
the spectrum between the Venus tendency and the Adonis tendency, there will be many
syncretists who disagree with one another on precisely what may be allegorized, and what may

83 Nuttall, The Alternative Trinity, 25.
Jennings 20
be included in the ideal syncretic fusion. Some, like John Donne, for instance, might accept
aspects of Neoplatonism, Hermeticism, and Cabalism, but downplay (or outright reject) the
overtly Old Testament Jehovah-reducing aspect of Gnosticism.84 The point is simply that all such
syncretists will approximate the Venus tendency more than the Adonis tendency. Moreover, as I
will show, Venus will embody an ‘extremist’85 strain of syncretism whose fusion does in fact
involve this overtly Old Testament Jehovah-reducing aspect of Gnosticism. For this reason, I
will use the word ‘Gnostic’ to describe her hermeneutical tendency.
Broadly speaking, the other hermeneutical tendency, that of Adonis, is the rigidly fixed,
literalistic, dogmatic tendency exemplified, for instance, by a more ‘extremist,’ fundamentalist
subset of Protestant Puritanism (or a fundamentalist strain of Calvinism, or a rigidly dogmatic
strain of Roman Catholicism, etc.) The Adonis tendency is one that, in the case of the Protestant
Puritan of 1593 (who would not have actually called him- or herself a ‘Puritan’), views the
Geneva Bible as the one true revelation of the one true God, which is to be read as literally as
possible from beginning to end. One is to avoid, wherever possible, imposing one’s personal
interpretation onto the text, and one is to eschew any allegorical interpretation when a literalistic
alternative is available.
86 One is to believe as many true doctrines and as few false ones as
possible, lest one’s heresies betray a counterfeit conversion and land one in the lake of fire.87 All
other religions (including Catholicism and the lukewarm Christianity of the various Protestant
sects) lead their believers into eternal torment. All other religious literature, and all extra-biblical
fables, are Luciferian deceptions whose only purpose is to deceive would-be saints out or their

heavenly reward through the allure of counterfeit wisdom.88 The syncretism expressed by the
‘Gnostic’ Venus tendency is itself the great end times deception whereby Satan waters down the
truth and overthrows the true and living God’s authority.89 Individual Protestants (even
individual Puritans or individual Calvinists) might disagree with each other on crucial issues, and
may themselves be highly adept at allegoresis (may read much of the Bible in allegorical rather
than purely literalistic terms). But the point is simply that Protestantism will approximate the
Adonis tendency more than it will the Venus tendency, and more serious, ‘fundamentalist’
subsets of Protestantism will approximate the Adonis tendency even more so. I use the word
‘Puritanical’ because, while a given ‘Protestant’ may exemplify the Venus tendency more than
the Adonis tendency, it is highly unlikely (if not outright impossible) to imagine a ‘Puritan’
(someone called ‘Puritanical’ by his or her opponents) exemplifying the Venus tendency more
than the Adonis tendency.
Overall, while the terms ‘Puritanical’ and ‘Gnostic’ are problematic and rather ahistorical
terms to apply to the poem Venus and Adonis, I will nevertheless, for the sake of simplicity, use
the first word, in a somewhat figurative way, to approximate the Adonis tendency (not in an
effort to accurately represent it, but in an attempt to capture how the poem views it as being
‘read’ by the opposing tendency), and the second word, figuratively, to approximate the Venus
tendency (again, not in an effort to accurately represent it, but in an attempt to capture how the
poem views it as being ‘read’ by the opposing tendency). Throughout my reading, I will
therefore call Adonis a ‘Puritan’ (and ‘Puritanical’) and Venus a ‘Gnostic’ and refer to these two
antithetical forces in what will appear (for someone who has not read this introduction) to be a

simplistic manner. If, for example, Adonis happens to be a gross caricature of a ‘Puritanical’
person who would resent that label, this would not render the term ‘Puritan figure’ inapplicable
to him (any more than Nathaniel Hawthorne’s gross caricature of ‘Puritans’ in The Scarlet Letter
would render the term “Puritan figure” inapplicable to them).
90 I will further unpack the
difficulties with these words (and make my reasons for using them more explicit) in my opening
chapter.
While Katherine Eisaman Maus finds Hughes’s insights helpful in writing her preface for
the Norton Shakespeare Anthology’s edition of the poem,91 and while Philip C. Kolin includes
Hughes’s insights in his critical history as a relevant point of contrast for the reader’s
consideration,92 Hughes’s reading of the poem has largely been overlooked.93 While a surface
reading—even a careful surface reading—of the poem might find Hughes’s reading “eccentric”
and fruitless, as Anthony Mortimer does,94 sufficient sympathy with its mythic dimension,
supported by adequate background knowledge in the relevant (but now highly arcane) areas in
Renaissance Esotericism, may validate its ‘Puritanical-Gnostic hermeneutical tendency’
extension as a fruitful reading model. In Variable Passions, Mortimer denigrates the “visionary
solemnities” of the allegorists,
95 and provides a close sequential reading of the poem which is
designed, in part, to repudiate the practice of allegoresis. But, as I will show, when Mortimer’s

close sequential reading is viewed through the ‘Puritanical-Gnostic’ lens Hughes invites, and
when this lens is itself bolstered by the illuminating historicist work Margaret Healy has done in
Shakespeare, Alchemy and the Creative Imagination, it may in fact reconcile the moralistallegorist camp with the comic-erotic camp, resolve the ostensibly irresolvable oppositions
which the ‘intentional ambivalence’ camp valorizes, and actually confute Mortimer’s attempted
repudiation of allegoresis. Because this synergistic stone kills, as it were, so many birds at once,
my thesis will rely heavily on Mortimer’s close sequential readings and Healy’s historicist work,
to the extent that it will even develop a kind of meta-critical aspect, where my reading will, at
times, be (for example) as much a reading of Mortimer as it will be of Shakespeare.
Muir thinks “we see everything through Venus’ eyes,”96 and Hamilton agrees when he
observes “Shakespeare’s temptress is the subject through whom we see all the action”97—an
implausible construal that may explain much of the critical confusion the poem has engendered.
Kolin writes that “[o]ne of the continuing problems in interpreting Adonis is identifying the
exact epistemological space in which we as readers can know and respond to him,”98 and the
same may certainly be said of Venus. While Mortimer’s close sequential readings allow us to see
how and when the poem’s perspectival shifts take place, the ‘Puritanical-Gnostic’ lens I offer via
Hughes’s insight provides an epistemological framework through which we might profitably
conceptualize why and to what effect the poem’s shifts take place. Through this synergistic
approach, we might respond to the poem’s enigmatic characters in a cohesive manner and further
reconcile its ostensibly disparate dimensions. It is with this conciliatory goal in mind that I shall
proceed through the poem.

In Chapter One, I draw the crucial distinctions between the two diametrically opposed
hermeneutical tendencies which, for the sake of simplicity, I am calling ‘Gnostic’ and
‘Puritanical.’ I then unpack the poem’s epigraph as a signature of ‘theosophical elitism.’ Here I
will consider evidence that shows contemporaries of Shakespeare engaged in an Esoteric reading
method consistent with my allegorical reading of ‘veiled Gnostic wisdom’ in the poem (‘esoteric
wisdom’ that was to be ‘veiled’ from ‘common’ eyes; hence the phrase ‘theosophical elitism’). I
then provide a survey of evidence of Venus’s (and the poet’s) inversion of Biblical doctrines via
their consistent employment of the ‘Gnostic’ law of reversal. In Chapter Two, I provide a close
sequential reading of the poem’s first 204 lines via Mortimer’s Variable Passions to show how
the ‘Puritanical-Gnostic’ structure I propose presents itself, unfolds itself, and reinforces itself
sequentially throughout the poem. In my Conclusion, I analyze Adonis’s longest speech to show
how the antithetical structure I reveal through my readings is clearly reinforced at the very
surface level of the text through the sharp contrast in rhetorical style and linguistic content
between the speech of Venus and that of Adonis.

CHAPTER ONE: PURITANISM VS. GNOSTICISM
Chapter One is divided into three sections. In section one, I give an overview of the
poem’s antithetical structure. Here I will draw the crucial distinctions between the two
diametrically opposed hermeneutical tendencies presented in, and reinforced throughout, the
poem. I am calling these two hermeneutical tendencies ‘Puritanical’ and ‘Gnostic,’ respectively.
Here I will situate my use of these terms with respect to current scholarship on their usage, and
further unpack what I mean by them. In section two, I analyze the poem’s epigraph, take the hint
which it seems to give of a “meaning denied to the common reader,”99 and show how its
suggestion of theosophical elitism gives a strong ground for reading the poem allegorically
through the lens of Gnosticism. Here I will argue that the poem’s theosophical elitism is
consistent with the elitism of the Gnostics which Irenaeus condemns in Against Heresies,
100 as
well as with the reading practices of such ‘Gnostic’ initiates as the Renaissance philosophers
Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola, and such contemporaries of Shakespeare as Sir Francis
Bacon, Michael Maier, and Henry Reynolds (regarding poetry more broadly), and Abraham
Fraunce, George Sandys, and the mythographer Natales Comes (regarding the Venus and Adonis
fable in particular). I will also show that ‘Gnostic’ initiates (Rosicrucians) of the Romantic
period read the fable in a manner consistent with my allegorical reading of Shakespeare’s
version. In section three, I present evidence of Venus’s (and the poet’s) employment of the
Gnostic law of reversal throughout the poem. Here I will show that Venus (and the poet)
consistently invert the Biblical literalist’s doctrines by directly inverting Biblical doctrines,
parables, and injunctions, as well as obliquely echoing Biblical phrases in subversive ways.

The Poem’s Antithetical Structure
My argument is that the poem’s antithetical structure is forged between two mutually
exclusive hermeneutical tendencies, rather than two clearly definable systems of thought
restricted to a specific historical movement and geographical location. For the sake of simplicity,
I have chosen to adopt the rather ahistorical and not entirely accurate labels ‘Puritanical’ and
‘Gnostic’ to describe these two hermeneutical tendencies, to capture how each hermeneutical
tendency is ‘read’ by the other. In current scholarship, both terms are highly controversial. I will
unpack each word individually before I relate them to each other. I will start with ‘Puritanism.’
According to Glenn Miller, attempting to define the word ‘Puritan’ or ‘Puritanism’ is
“one of the most frustrating tasks in all of scholarship.”101 Ian Hugh Clary observes that “like
any other socio-historical phenomena,” the terms are “notoriously difficult to define,” and
“[h]istorians of early modern Britain have long disagreed as to the nature and extent of English
Puritanism.”102 John Coffey observes that “[h]istorians have agonized over [the word’s]
definition.”103 There appears to be no scholarly consensus as to i) how the term is to be properly
defined, as to ii) what constitutes a Puritan, as to iii) when Puritanism began, as to iv) when the
movement ended (if it ever ended), as to v) whether it is a movement restricted to early modern
England or whether the ‘Separatists’ who fled to America may also be properly called Puritans,
as to vi) whether it is to be restricted to a time period stretching (roughly speaking) from the midsixteenth century to the mid- or maybe late-seventeenth century, or whether the ‘spirit’ of

Jennings 27
‘Puritanism’ may be said to long precede (and long exceed) the sixteenth century historical
movement (and still be alive and well today). In “Toward a Definition of ‘Puritan’ and
‘Puritanism’: A Study in Puritan Historiography,” Brian H. Cosby provides a historically rooted
definition with which many scholars would disagree, but one which, it seems to me, is (as far as
restrictive definitions go) as good as any other:
A ‘Puritan’ was one who, politically, reacted against the via media of the
Elizabethan Settlement in favour of a more thorough reformation in England;
who, socially, promoted evangelism, catechism, and spiritual nourishment
through the preaching and teaching of the Bible; who, theologically, held the
views of Luther’s doctrine of faith (sola fide), Calvin’s doctrine of grace (sola
gratia), and the Reformers’ doctrine of Scripture (sola scriptura); and who,
devotionally, strove for personal holiness, a practical faith, communion with God,
and the glory of God in all things.104
Clary agrees with the fundamentals of Cosby’s definition but disagrees with the particulars: for
Clary, Puritans generally subscribed to the doctrine of salvation by grace through faith rather
than works, but not all Puritans would have simply subscribed to Luther’s doctrine of faith as
formulated by Luther, or to Calvin’s doctrine of grace as formulated by Calvin, etc. Clary
cautions that the “variegated nature of Puritanism tends to be downplayed as certain works are
emphasized to the neglect of others” and that it is “requisite for historians to recognize such
popular limitations and strive to move beyond them to seek a definition that accounts for the

Historiography,” Churchman 122, 4 (2008), 307.
Jennings 28
breadth and diversity of Puritan thought.”105 Cosby is aware of these difficulties, for he himself
cautions:
Mindful of the fact that the Puritans themselves were quite diverse, we would be
wise to be more flexible when giving summary definitions, lists of qualifications,
and time-frames. May we endeavour to understand these ‘intense Protestants’ for
who they really were and not for what the modern world has often portrayed them
to be—killjoys, radical oppressors, and sectarian hypocrites—for they were men
and women who sought a life of holiness unto their God.106
While there seems to be little consensus among scholars of Puritanism about the fine
details, there appears to be a consensus (or something like it) that Puritans neither called
themselves nor thought of themselves as ‘Puritans.’ Moreover, there was no clearly definable
group of people in the sixteenth century who could be said to fit the label. The word ‘Puritan’
was, rather, a slur used to label someone a “bigot, killjoy or extremist.”107 J. I. Packer argues that
the epithet ‘Puritan’ was applied to “five overlapping groups of people: clergy who chafed under
the Prayer Book; advocates of Presbyterianism; those who practiced Calvinistic piety; doctrinal
Calvinists; and gentry who showed public support for the things of God.”
108 Patrick Collinson
puts it more straightforwardly: both Anglicans and Puritans are Protestants, but the latter is a
“hotter sort of Protestant.”
109 The word ‘Puritan’ was, then, a slur applied to (broadly speaking)
serious Protestant Biblical literalists who saw the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of

England as heretical, and who simply sought the freedom to practice their serious form of
Christian worship, which they viewed as being true to the (one true) Bible. Because the slur
would have been applied to different kinds of believers who may have differed on several crucial
questions of doctrine, no one set of beliefs can be ascribed to every Puritan. It must be kept in
mind that Adonis is one character and not thousands of characters. But, if indeed he is one on
whom the slur ‘Puritan’ or ‘Puritanical’ might be bestowed by his opponents, it should not be
entirely outrageous if I use the Geneva Bible itself (on which the ‘Puritan’ based all his or her
beliefs and practices) to approximate Adonis’s hermeneutical tendency. As the ‘Puritan’ is a
serious Protestant (a fundamentalist Biblical literalist, where ‘fundamentalist’ refers, in objective
terms, to adherence to the fundamentals of the Bible, rather than, in negative terms, to a
dangerous form of extremism, and where ‘literalist’ does not wholly exclude a grasp of
metaphorical language and allegoresis), it is the Geneva Bible itself, read as literally as possible
from beginning to end, which (in 1593) would have served as the closest approximation of what
I am calling the ‘Puritanical’ Adonis tendency. The problems involved in doing so are obvious
and I am well aware of them, but so long as it is understood that my citations of the Geneva
Bible serve as a very rough approximation of a tendency antithetical to the ‘Gnostic’ Venus
tendency, and that I am citing verses that the ‘Puritan’ would (or would be likely to) use to
defend his or her position (rather than citing them to demonstrate how they must be read), the
Geneva Bible itself should serve as a reliable frame of reference. Moreover, as I will show, it is
the doctrines, parables, injunctions, and phrases of the Geneva Bible itself that Venus (and the
poet) are constantly inverting and subversively echoing throughout the poem. As such, one
cannot avoid using the Geneva Bible itself to approximate the perspective that is being
challenged by Venus (and the poet).

As for Gnosticism, Steven Davies writes that
Today many people have left the comfort of the churches or synagogues they
grew up in and have decided to understand religion for themselves, to be
“spiritual” rather than to be part of any organized religion, perhaps to combine
ideas from Buddhism and Judaism and Catholicism into a new synthesis that they
create themselves. In ancient times, mainly in the first through the fourth
centuries, religious thinkers of this sort were called “Gnostics.”110
He goes on to write that
Irenaeus, the Bishop of Lugdunum in Gaul (now Lyon, France) wrote a long
savage attack against the Gnostics entitled “The Refutation and Overthrow of the
Knowledge (Gnosis) Falsely So Called,” in which he says angrily that “since their
teachings and traditions are different, and the newer ones among them claim to be
constantly finding something new, and working out what no one ever thought of
before, it is hard to describe their views.” Irenaeus was certainly right about
that.111
In Rethinking “Gnosticism”: An Argument for Dismantling a Dubious Category, Michael A.
Williams argues that because the ancient Gnostic writers came up with so many different
variations on their own thought, because they syncretized so many ostensibly disparate
philosophical systems and synthesized so much ostensibly irreconcilable mythic material, and
because the term has subsequently attracted so many diverse meanings and interpretations, the

word has ceased to be useful.112 And yet it is precisely this ever-malleable, highly syncretic, and
therefore ever-elusive aspect of Gnosticism that makes it the best word to describe the Venus
tendency. Moreover, the chief characteristics common among all the ostensibly disparate
systems developed by the Gnostics are, I will argue, shared by the tendency expressed by Venus.
Regarding all these ostensibly disparate systems developed by the ‘Gnostics’ (not all of whom
would have called themselves Gnostics, and many of whom would have resented the label as a
slur), Robert Mc L. Wilson writes that
The chief characteristics common to all the developed systems are: (1) a radical
cosmic dualism that rejects this world and all that belongs to it: the body is a
prison from which the soul longs to escape; (2) a distinction between the
unknown transcendent true God and the creator or Demiurge, commonly
identified with the God of the Hebrew Bible; (3) the belief that the human race is
essentially akin to the divine, being a spark of heavenly light imprisoned in a
material body; (4) a myth, often narrating a premundane fall, to account for the
present human predicament; and (5) the saving knowledge by which deliverance
is effected and the gnostic awakened to recognition of his or her true nature and
heavenly origin.113
A. D. Nuttall writes that the “idea that the power which made the world is wicked, not good, is
the central proposition of Gnosticism.”114 Needless to say, this view is diametrically opposed to
the ‘Puritanical’ view that the power which made the world (the triune God of the Geneva Bible)

alone is good.115 For the ‘Puritan,’ Jesus Christ is the God of the Hebrew Bible made flesh, for
he is the Word of God (who was God in the very beginning), through whom everything was
created;
116 for the ‘Gnostic,’ as Wilson’s definition shows, the God of the Hebrew Bible is a
lesser deity, a wicked Demiurge who has trapped us in matter. A popular misunderstanding is
that orthodox Christianity sees Jesus Christ and the Jehovah of the Hebrew Old Testament as
vastly different Gods. This is actually a classic Gnostic formulation of the trinity. Nuttall writes
that in “orthodox Christianity the Trinity is a happy family; the Father and the Son get on well,
see things from the same ethical point of view. For the Ophites the Trinity is a dysfunctional
family; the Son is the antagonist of the Father.”117 Nuttall writes that the word ‘Gnosticism’ is
“derived from the Greek gnosis, which means ‘knowledge.’”118 The broadly ‘Gnostic’ tradition
views salvation as being contingent upon acquisition of esoteric knowledge that is to be obtained
through engagement with the invisible world. Conversely, the ‘Puritan’ tradition anathematizes
both the invisible world and gnosis (‘science falsely so called’) and subscribes to a doctrine of
salvation by grace through faith. Specific subsets of Gnosticism, such as the Ophites, even saw
the serpent in the Garden of Eden as humanity’s saviour. The eighteenth century German
Lutheran Church historian Johann Lorenz von Mosheim writes that the Ophites believed “the
serpent by which our first parents were deceived, was either CHRIST himself or sophia [wisdom],
concealed under the form of that animal.”
119 As Nuttall summarizes the view, “The serpent leads

us to gnosis and is therefore good.”120 Needless to say, this Gnostic view is diametrically
opposed to the ‘Puritanical’ view that the serpent is to be identified with Satan, man’s perennial
adversary. 121
I am not entirely alone in arguing for Gnosticism in Shakespeare. In The Alternative
Trinity, Nuttall argues that Gnosticism is to be found in Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus, Milton’s
Paradise Lost, and William Blake’s poetry, and in Shakespeare the Thinker, Nuttall argues that
the “preliminary structure” of Shakespeare’s Measure for Measure is “Ophite Gnostic in its
readiness to merge the Devil with Christ.”122 He argues that there “is no great problem . . . in
supposing that [Shakespeare] could have known something of the Gnostics.”123 He observes that,
for example, Marlowe “knew the (pseudo-)Clementine Recognitions, which contains some
vertiginous Gnostic material.”124 Harold Bloom, who has referred to himself as a Gnostic,125 sees
Shakespeare’s Macbeth as being “set in a Gnostic cosmos,” but he qualifies this claim by adding
that “Shakespeare’s own vision is,” however, “by no means Gnostic in spirit.”126 Perhaps equally
surprising, in The Gnostic Paradigm: Forms of Knowing in English Literature of the Middle
Ages, Natanela Elias argues that the Pearl poet, William Langland’s Piers Plowman, and John
Gower’s Confessio Amatis, while ostensibly orthodox, all contain unorthodox elements of
Gnosticism beneath the surface.127 A vast number of Shakespeare’s contemporaries have been

identified with the more broadly ‘Gnostic’ (esoteric knowledge-seeking) tradition, and some with
the explicitly Old Testament Jehovah-reducing, man-deifying aspect of Gnosticism. For
example, in Gnostic Apocalypse: Jacob Boehme’s Haunted Narrative, Cyril O’Regan argues that
the visionary discourse of Shakespeare’s contemporary Jacob Boehme, though outwardly
Lutheran, ultimately represented a return to Gnosticism.128 Shakespeare’s contemporary
Cornelius Agrippa wrote of transforming himself, through occult power that was itself to be
cultivated through acquisition of esoteric knowledge, “into that image which is God.”129 Nuttall
writes of Agrippa’s “linking of the notions of humanity and divine sonship, not according to the
orthodox theology of incarnation but in the oblique, disturbing manner of the Gnostics.”
130
Nuttall adds, “[y]et all these Renaissance figures thought of themselves as Christians.”131 None
of these scholars is unaware of the fact that such applications of the term ‘Gnostic’ are
anachronistic and deeply surprising; they all sympathize with their readers who find their
suggestions radical. But the claim is simply that, just as there was a return to Neoplatonism,
Hermeticism, and Cabalism in the early modern period, so too was there such a return to
Gnosticism (as there was in the Medieval and Romantic periods).
The term ‘Gnosticism’ straightforwardly captures Venus’s Sophianic status (her status as
the Gnostic Sophia), as well as the broader hermeneutical ‘Venus’ tendency exemplified by those
early modern syncretists who subscribed to a confluence of Gnosticism, Hermeticism,
Neoplatonism, Cabalism, and Christianity which, as Hughes discusses and as Margaret Healy so

thoroughly illuminates in her pioneering study, exerted an inestimable (albeit elusive) influence
upon the early modern period as a whole, and on early modern poetry in particular. As I will
argue, Venus is a Hermeticist in that she, like the spiritual alchemist inspired by the Hermetic
Corpus, is intent on synthesizing all ostensibly mutually exclusive antitheses (including
humanity with divinity, masculinity with femininity, Protestantism with Catholicism, ‘Biblical’
Christianity with Neoplatonism, Cabalism, Gnosticism, etc.)132 She is a Neoplatonist in that she,
in her capacity as the Neoplatonic Form of Love, seeks to acquire Divine Truth though the
Neoplatonic Form of Beauty that is Adonis.133 She is a Cabalist in that she, like the early modern
Christian cabalists, allegorizes—rather than literalizes—the surface text of the Bible, as is
evidenced by the way she inverts the Biblical literalist’s doctrines.134 She is the Goddess Sophia
in that, just as in the Gnostic Sophia myth, she has fallen, through a mysterious intellectual error
of her own, from heaven (in the Gnostic myth, from the Pleromatic center of the heavenly
heights)
135 to give birth (and in a sense become) the reality in which we dwell.136 In the process
she gives birth to her son Jaldabaoth (the demiurge whom the Puritanical Adonis worships and
with whom he is in another sense identical) by whom she is rejected and in whose false reality

135 In “Gnosticism,” Davies describes the Pleroma as “conceptual and therefore below the level
of the indescribable God.” Sophia’s error is that she (the Wisdom of God) “seeks to know God
objectively,” when “God is purely subjective. God’s Wisdom imagines God and, although an
imaginary God is unreal, it yet takes on a kind of inferior illusory being of its own outside of
God’s realm. This lower god has the name Yaldabaoth [or Ialdabaoth or Jaldabaoth] and is to be
identified with Yahweh [or Jehovah] of the Hebrew Bible.” This wicked demiurge who traps the
divine spark of humanity in gross matter “makes the human being ignorant of its origins. But the
divine mind sends down a messenger (Jesus, in the Christian version of the tale) to give human
beings true “gnosis” by which they can go back to the perfect divine realm.”

Jennings 36
she becomes ‘imprisoned’ and reduced to a love-sick mortal.137 As in the Gnostic Sophia myth,
Venus must be reunited with the “Aeon Jesus” (the divine revealer and consummator of Gnosis)
that is her Sacred Bridegroom (that was her other half in the very beginning of things).
138 He is
to emerge out of the false reality to which she has given birth and rescue her from it.139 This
“Aeon Jesus” is latent in Adonis and is the key to her rescue, but because he has devolved
through Puritanism into the Jaldabaoth demiurge, he misperceives her, rejects her, and reduces
the Goddess that she is into a diabolical whore as Biblical literalism has done.140
Irenaeus’s Against Heresies, a text which would have been available to Shakespeare,
thoroughly reveals to us a Church Father’s view of Gnosticism. It provides a detailed account of
the Gnostic Sophia myth (as viewed through Irenaeus’s ‘Puritanical’ perception). The Puritanical
Adonis, in line with Irenaeus, perceives this Gnostic myth to be a Luciferian lie. For him, Sophia
is really Lucifer who fell from heaven.141 She is not the mother of a wicked demiurge. Rather,
she is a creation of the true and living God, who cast her out of heaven for rebelling against him.
She deceives her followers into turning the world upside down so that she may be viewed as the
mother of—and therefore as higher than—the most High God. The Puritan’s perception of
Sophia’s offer of Gnosis (ascension into divinity through esoteric knowledge in the here and
now) is captured in the poem by the “curious mixture” of “forbidden knowledge” (“A thousand

“antithesis of Jaldabaoth”—a “spiritual angelic brother of the material titanic daemon” who
“rescues her, lifts her out of her debasement among the demons [of the world of suffering into
which she has fallen (and accidentally created)] and becomes her ‘Sacred Bridegroom,’ both
together marrying into a reunion with the Divine Fullness of Heaven,” 352.

honey secrets shalt thou know,” 16) and “prelapsarian innocence” (“Here come and sit where
never serpent hisses,” 17),142 which Venus promises Adonis—that same “curious mixture”
which, according to the Puritanical Adonis, was offered by the serpent to Eve in the Garden of
Eden.143 Crucial to this distinction between Puritanism and Gnosticism is the fact that, on
Puritanism, Man alone is deified, while on Gnosticism, the Goddess Sophia is superior to the
Goddess-eschewing, Man-deifying Demiurge of the Hebrew Bible.
With these antithetical distinctions in mind, let us now turn to the poem’s epigraph.
The Epigraph as a Signature of Theosophical Elitism
The poem’s epigraph corroborates Healy’s perception of “theosophical elitism” in the
Shakespearean corpus,144 and offers a strong ground for reading Venus and Adonis allegorically
through the lens of Gnosticism: it quotes, in the original Latin, 1.15.35-36 of Ovid’s Amores, the
first clause of which reads something like, “Let the vulgar throng admire vile things.” In “Time
Beguiling Sport: Number Symbolism in Shakespeare’s Venus and Adonis,” Christopher Butler
and Alastair Fowler write that
Numerological patterns are not perhaps so contrary to expectation in the works of a
Benlowes, a Spenser, or even a Milton; but the current conception of Shakespeare
does not encourage us to look for esoteric structures in his poetry. And yet, doesn’t
his Ovidian epigraph hint at the possibility of a meaning denied to the common
reader?145

Hamilton observes that in the Countess of Pembroke’s Iuychurch (1592), Shakespeare’s
contemporary Abraham Fraunce “translates certain Ovidian myths and adds philosophical
explications, for he believed, in common with his age, that poetry is radically allegorical.”146 In
his discussion of poetry, Fraunce classifies readers into three groups. He distinguishes those who
are i) “but of a meane conceit,” whose “rurall humor” may be fed by “a pleasant and plausible
narration . . . set forth in most sweete and delightsome verse,” from ii) those “whose capacitie is
such” that “they can reach somewhat further then the external discourse and history” to “finde a
morall sence included therein.”147 He further distinguishes these two groups from the iii) “rest,
that are better borne and of a more noble spirit,” who “shall meete with hidden mysteries of
naturall, astrological, or diuine and metaphysicall philosophie, to entertaine their heauenly
speculation.”148 While Healy’s pioneering study is supported by the work of such intellectual
historians as Paolo Rossi, Charles Webster, and Allen G. Debus,149 and such early modern
literature scholars as Alastair Fowler, Lyndy Abraham, Charles Nicholl, Stanton J. Linden, and
John S. Melbane,150 and has been rather favorably reviewed by such scholars as Catherine

Gimelli Martin and John Slater,151 such lines of inquiry as her work represents have been largely
overlooked by academic Shakespeareans. In her review of Healy’s pioneering study, Katherine
Duncan-Jones identifies shortcomings in Healy’s work at the level of fine detail, but betrays her
own short-sightedness when she writes that it is “hard to see why a writer always admired for his
naturalism as a playwright should decide to attempt such learned, dark and complex allegorical
modes as are proposed here.”152 Maurice Evans notes that the “Elizabethans were more flexible
readers than we are, able to accept simultaneously, and yet enjoy separately, the levels of
allegorical myth and naturalistic narrative.”153 Healy is well aware of the naturalistic dimension
of Shakespeare’s work and concurs with Evans when she writes that, “where we . . . find
troubling divisions and incompatible binaries, Shakespeare’s ‘private friends’ . . . undoubtedly
encountered productive fusion.”154 It is only fitting, then, that in the Countess, Fraunce
“translates Ovid’s story of Venus and Adonis in highly erotic terms, and appends, without any
sense of incongruity, a highly philosophical explication.”155 Fraunce writes:
By Adonis, is meant the sunne, by Venus, the vpper hemisphere of the earth (as by

Proserpina the lower); by the boare, winter: by the death of Adonis, the absence
of the sunne for the sixe wintrie moneths; all which time, the earth lamenteth:
Adonis is wounded in those parts, which are the instruments of propagation: for,
in winter the son seemeth impotent, and the earth barren: neither that being able to
get, nor this to beare either fruite or flowres: and therefore Venus sits, lamentably
hanging downe her head, leaning on her left hand, her garments all ouer her face.156
As Hamilton notes, the “potentialities of the Venus-Adonis myth, as Shakespeare inherited it,
were enormous: possibly, a naive literalism; perhaps, but not likely with this myth, a moral
significance; and most likely, what Fraunce calls the ‘hidden mysteries of naturall . . .
philosophie.’”157 Hamilton concludes: “That Shakespeare shared Fraunce’s belief that poetry
treats the ‘hidden mysteries of naturall . . . philosophie’ is suggested by his choice of the VenusAdonis myth, 
and also by the Ovidian motto so daringly placed on the title-page of his poem.”158

George Sandys, another contemporary of Shakespeare’s, provides a comparable
commentary on the tenth book of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, which Butler and Fowler call a
“popular statement” on the matter,159 which further gives support for the early modern period’s
predilection for ‘radical’ allegoresis in general and its allegorical treatment of the fable in
particular.160 Muriel Bradbrook further reveals that a year before Shakespeare would dedicate
Venus and Adonis to Henry Wriothesley, John Clapham would dedicate to the same patron an
allegorical poem entitled Narcissus, written in Latin, upon which Shakespeare’s Venus and

Adonis is modelled, a poem which, it might be observed, reads like the inverted allegorical
sketch for Shakespeare’s version, in which all the same central elements are to be found, but
where Adonis (called Narcissus) ends up being pitched into a pool called Self-Love, and where
the horse is even called Lust.161 Moreover, Harwood cites Natales Comes162 as Spenser’s
“favourite mythographer” (from whose Faerie Queene, in turn, she argues Shakespeare drew
inspiration for his Venus and Adonis).163 Comes’s influence touched not only poets but also such
philosophers as Sir Francis Bacon, as is evidenced in Bacon’s much overlooked De Sapientia
Veterum (“Of the Wisdom of the Ancients”).164 In its preface Bacon states that “beneath no small
number of the fables of the ancient poets there lay from the very beginning a mystery and an
allegory,” and in the book he allegorizes myths pertinent to Shakespeare’s Venus and Adonis,
such as the Narcissus fable.165 As Hulse relates, while ruminating over a passage in Euripides,
Comes discovers Harmony to be “the offspring of the elements of all things; and that force which
is born from the motion of celestial bodies, whether we call it divine or natural, acting so that the
elements themselves are led into this mixture, or rather leading them, that force is called
Venus.”166 Consistent with Comes’s view is Hulse’s observation that “Shakespeare’s Venus
strives to harmonize the elements, as they appear in various guises: in climatic terms, they are
wind, sun, earth, and rain; in emotional terms, sighs, desires, disdain, and tears.”167 According to

my reading, Venus, as the Gnostic Sophia, strives to harmonize all ostensibly mutually exclusive
antitheses through a kind of Hermetic alchemy and it is the recalcitrant Puritanism of Adonis
against which her syncretic project strives. Given that Against Heresies is a classic enunciation
of the ‘Puritanical’ view of Gnosticism (of which Shakespeare was likely aware), the
overemphasis which Shakespeare’s narrator places on the Goddess’s sweat and tears may be
explained by a synthesis of Comes’s ‘discovery’ and a passage in Against Heresies, where
Irenaeus ridicules the Gnostic myth’s etiological account of the earth’s waters. Irenaeus relates
that, according to the Gnostic myth, the earth’s waters are composed wholly of Sophia’s tears.
Taking the myth literally, Irenaeus sees a difficulty with this explanation and quips that, if her
tears explain the earth’s salt water, what but her sweat could explain the earth’s fresh water?168
That Shakespeare’s poem may be read as allegory is clearly confirmed by the readings of
Baldwin, Pearson, Price, Hamilton, Hulse, Butler, Fowler, and Prescott, but what we want to
know is whether it is beyond the pale to conceive of Shakespeare as having concealed the
mysteries of his Gnostic doctrine in what has appeared to most readers a tale of mere trifles.169
Hughes argues Shakespeare lifted the myth out of its leafy Ovidian recess and re-theologized
it.170 I have clarified and extended Hughes’s argument to suggest we read the poem’s antithetical
structure as a specifically ‘Puritanical-Gnostic’ one forged between two diametrically opposed
hermeneutical tendencies. That it may be so read can only be demonstrated through the kind of
close sequential reading I will provide it. Nevertheless, it might serve my reading well to
consider the precise extent to which Renaissance initiates of the ‘Gnostic’ mysteries read
allegories into the classical poetry upon which were modelled the poems they themselves wrote.

The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ranks Marsilio Ficino as the “best known philosopher
of the Renaissance.”171 Healy writes that, in Marsilio Ficino’s scheme, “non-egotistical religious
love” (as embodied by Venus) “was more important than doctrinal religion” (as embodied by
Adonis) and “Orphic Hymns, Greek myths and Platonic dialogues were envisaged as
allegorically encoding the wisdom of the ancient sage of Egypt,” the thrice-great Hermes
Trismegistus (where we understand Hermeticism to be a central element in the confluence I am
calling Gnosticism).172 John S. Mebane even refers to the Hermetic Corpus straightforwardly as
a corpus of explicitly “Gnostic texts,”
173 and to “Florentine Neoplatonism” as a “complex
interaction among humanism, scholasticism, and the Neoplatonic and Gnostic philosophies
which had influenced the radical sects,”
174 the “resulting compound” of which was, according to
Mebane, the “intellectual foundation of the occult tradition which spread throughout Europe and
to which Marlowe, Jonson, and Shakespeare responded.”175 This Hermetic Occult
Neoplatonism,176 championed by such other philosophical dignitaries as Pico della Mirandola

172 In the early centuries A.D., Alexandrian Gnosticism became such a confluence of
Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, Cabalism, and Christianity, as in the teachings of Valentinus. It
appears it may have even originated as one such confluence. See Irenaeus, Ch. I on Valentinus.
Irenaeus relates in detail the syncretic practice of the Gnostics whereby myths and fables from
disparate traditions are synthesized and Biblical passages appropriated haphazardly to support
extra-canonical doctrines which otherwise conflict with a literalistic interpretation of the Bible.
See Irenaeus, VIII.i. and Isaiah 28:13 GNV for what the Biblical literalist understands to be a
condemnation of this practice.

176 What Hughes and Healy call it.
Jennings 44
Donne177 lent itself to Renaissance Alchemy as a ‘spiritual technology’ whereby all diametrically
opposed mythologies might be synthesized through Cabalistic Love. Through this ideal synthesis
it was thought that humanity might recover the ‘true religion’ of which every mythological
system (including that of the Bible) was but a pale shadow. Through this syncretic fusion man
might transcend the fetters of dogma, put aside superficial differences between himself and his
neighbour, recover that knowledge that has always been his to possess, and finally realize the
godhood latent within him (and, to boot, purge humanity of the ‘Puritanical’ sexism latent within
this sentence’s pronoun usage). Healy writes that in Bruno’s scheme,
paradoxes and contradictions are fusions of two extremes into a harmonic one and
the driving force for this conjunction is love/desire (this is, of course, the philosophy of late sixteenth-century Hermetic alchemy with its symbolic ‘copulations,’
‘chemical weddings’ and ‘marriages’). In line with this, Bruno promulgated the
belief that the revival of Egyptian religion, as expounded in the writings of Hermes Trismegistus, especially the Asclepius, offered a way of reuniting Catholic
and Protestant Christendom and returning religion to its pristine state; a focus on
universal love was key to this regenerative spiritual alchemy.178
This passage almost serves as a summary of Hughes’s reading of Venus and Adonis. Here we
have Catholic Christendom (as embodied, at the level of the first veil, in Venus), Protestant
Christendom (as embodied in Adonis), and the alchemist-poet trying—through Venus as
Goddess of Love—to ‘reunite’ the two through ‘copulation’ in order to return religion to its

177 Donne’s and Sidney’s personal systems are, strictly speaking, less overtly ‘Gnostic’ in the
Jehovah-reducing sense than the confluence I would ascribe to Venus and the poem’s narrator,
but nevertheless highly Esoteric and importantly antithetical to the ‘Puritanical’ Adonis
tendency.

“pristine state”—the undogmatic, lived, experiential state of spirituality to which the syncretic
Gnostic aspires. The antithetical model I propose is consistent with the syncretic project
described in this passage, for according to my reading, it is this i) great alchemical marriage
between all ostensibly mutually exclusive antitheses which Venus strives to achieve, and the i)
recalcitrant Puritanism of Adonis that precludes its consummation.
One example (among innumerable others) of a reading practice consistent with the model
I propose is to be found in Pico della Mirandola’s Oration on the Dignity of Man. The Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy ranks Mirandola as being, after Ficino, “the best known philosopher
of the Renaissance,” and declares “his Oration on the Dignity of Man” to be “better known than
any other philosophical text of the fifteenth century.”179 Mirandola famously composed 900
theses attempting to syncretize all theological and philosophical systems, a work which was, not
surprisingly, the first to be universally banned by the Roman Catholic Church.180 In this case,
though Mirandola and the Church are, strictly speaking, both Catholic, Mirandola is
approximating the ‘Gnostic’ Venus tendency through his ‘extremist’ syncretic project, whereas
the Roman Catholic Church itself is, at least insofar as it is banning Mirandola’s syncretic
project, approximating the ‘Puritanical’ Adonis tendency. In Oration on the Dignity of Man,
Mirandola defends the ‘Gnostic’ doctrine (while careful to avoid the word “Gnostic”) that one is
to immortalize oneself in the here and now through cultivation of occult ‘white magic’ power,
which is to be distinguished from its ‘black magic’ counterpart. This power is to be developed
through acquisition of esoteric knowledge, which is itself to be obtained via initiation into the
(Gnostic) mysteries. He then writes that Homer “concealed this doctrine”—a quite clearly

‘Gnostic’ doctrine—“symbolically, in the wanderings of his Ulysses, just as he did all other
learned doctrines.”181 Mirandola defends a Cabalistic—and therefore broadly ‘Gnostic’—
account of the Bible (again, being careful all the while to avoid the word “Gnostic”) when he
writes that the true God conceals his meaning from the vulgar masses, reserving it as he does for
an elite few:
Openly to reveal to the people the hidden mysteries and secret intentions of the
highest divinity, which lay concealed under the hard shell of the law and the rough
vesture of language, what else could this be but to throw holy things to dogs and
strew gems among swine?182
In this same work, Mirandola writes,
Orpheus . . . (and this was the case with all the ancient theologians) so wove the
mysteries of his doctrine into the fabric of myths and so wrapped them about in veils
of poetry, that one reading his hymns might well believe that there was nothing in
them but fables and the veriest commonplaces. I have said this so that it might be
known what labor was mine, what difficulty was involved, in drawing out the secret
meanings of the occult philosophy from the deliberate tangles of riddles and the
recesses of fable in which they were hidden; difficulty made all the greater by the
fact that in a matter so weighty, abstruse and unexplored, I could count on no help
from the work and efforts of other interpreters.183

Mirandola was widely read and heavily plagiarized throughout the Renaissance, as S. A.
Farmer shows in Syncretism in the West: Pico’s 900 Theses.
184 This exact quote is plagiarized
virtually verbatim by Henry Reynolds in his 1632 Mythomystes,
185 who, as Healy tells us, “reads
the Greek myths in the manner of Maier”—the prominent alchemist Michael Maier—“as
allegories and riddles of abstruse Hermetical-alchemical knowledge.”186 This Esoteric reading
practice, popularized by such philosophical dignitaries as Mirandola, seems to go beyond even
‘radical’ allegoresis: it understands poets to dissemble the “mysteries” of their “doctrine” in
“veils of poetry” to deceive the many into believing there is “nothing in them but fables and the
veriest commonplaces.” As I show in the third section of this chapter, and as I will further
demonstrate through my close sequential reading, Venus (and the poet) may be read as
employing the Gnostic law of reversal to cryptically invert the teachings of the sham Christ of
the Bible. Venus (and the poet) constantly subvert Biblical doctrines with such precision that the
employment of this law of reversal would be difficult to regard as purely coincidental with the
poem’s consistently reinforced Puritanical-Gnostic structure. To use Mirandola’s language, the
mysterious “doctrine” dissembled under the “veils of poetry” (under what Reynolds would call
the “poeticke maske”)187 of Venus and Adonis may be read as a Gnostic one: a Gnostic account
of what Hughes calls the Puritanical error. On this view, the poem explains, via Gnostic
epistemology, why Puritanism renders the Goddess (and the Gnostic wisdom she embodies) as it
does, and further serves as a warning for those who would reject her (who would, by extension,
anathematize the invisible world of the unconscious, upon engagement with which is contingent

the art of Gnostic illumination). The poem (as these Renaissance reading practices corroborate)
is to be understood as conveying one thing to what the Gnostic initiates, at the time, called the
“vulgar” throng188 (a mere tale of erotic trifles) and something entirely different to what they
called the “worthy initiated”189 (a Gnostic account of the Puritanical error); that is, one thing to
Fraunce’s first group, and something entirely different to the third group with whom he himself
identifies (and perhaps something still different to a fourth group of which he is himself
unaware). It is worth noting here that Irenaeus, in his condemnation of Gnosticism, attributes to
the Gnostic this strain of elitism whereby humanity is categorized into three groups: “animal
men” and “material men” (others) and those who are “spiritual by nature” (themselves).190
Perhaps even more to the point, Irenaeus writes that the Gnostics “tell us”—just as Mirandola
tells us—“that this knowledge has not been openly divulged, because all are not capable of
receiving it, but has been mystically revealed by the Saviour through means of parables to those
qualified for understanding it.”
191 This Gnostic elitism is echoed by Reynolds who, again using
similar language to Mirandola, maintains the necessity that these “high and Mysticall matters
should by riddles and enigmatical knots be kept inviolate from the prophane Multitude.”
192
On this reading, it is the “Hermetic” technique of what Healy calls “veiling truths from
common eyes”193 (in which “Philosophers never express the true significance of their thought in
the vulgar tongue,” and in which the Hermetic master’s words “must not be interpreted
according to the literal sense of the expression,” for the “sense which is presented on the surface

is not the true sense”)194 that is being employed throughout Venus and Adonis to subvert
Puritanical doctrine via Gnostic epistemology. While even among early moderns, this reading
practice of what we might call the ultra-radical allegorical variety might have been the
exception, among Renaissance initiates of the ‘Gnostic’ mysteries it was not. Such lucid
expositions of deliberate obscuration are legion: “In such a poem” as we might say Venus and
Adonis is, “the literal meaning of the plot is not the important one but intended only to lead
gullible fools astray and, to adopt Maier’s phrasing, the poet has succeeded in using a ‘veil of
colours’ and enigmas to obscure its spiritual allegory from all but the worthy initiated.”195
An apt analogue is to be found in Romantic poets such as Keats, who peered back through
the “veil” of fables of which Bacon speaks,196 and upon the Venus and Adonis story in particular
as my reading of the poem’s antithetical structure would suggest Shakespeare may have done.
The following quote from Jennifer N. Wunder’s Keats, Hermeticism, and the Secret Societies is
as specific a passage as one could be expected to find regarding the way in which mystery school
Gnostics (here Rosicrucians) read the fable in the Romantic period:
In hermetic terms, sexual consummation was viewed as symbolic of both the
‘essence’ and the means by which man must reach that essence through the
realities of life. Virtually every alchemical text Keats might have encountered
contained descriptions of sexualized unions, often described as marriages,
sometimes between a king and queen, other times between a goddess such as
Venus and her paramour Adonis, and some texts such as the Chymical Wedding
made use of aspects of both. Sexual love served as the exoteric metaphor and led

Jennings 50
quite naturally in these allegories to the more generalized and esoteric assertions
that it was through the power of love that a commingling of contraries took place
and a transmutation was achieved. The mystical union between man and woman,
the human and the divine, and the desirer and desired was understood as symbolic
of love as ‘all strength and power,’ the ‘Divine Nature’ and ‘Divine Elixir,’ and
that which ‘dissolves and changes [all] to itself . . . a transmuting and
transforming nature’ that ‘restores that which is fallen and degenerated to its
primary beauty, excellence and perfection.’197
Thus, in “hermetic terms,” “sexual consummation” is i) a mythic symbol for the elusive spiritual
“essence” to which the neophyte is to aspire, at the same time as it is the ii) “means by which
man must reach that essence” through the mundane “realities of life.” Here erotic love serves as
the “exoteric metaphor” for the alchemical mystery whereby a “commingling of contraries” takes
place and a “transmutation” is “achieved.” In Shakespeare’s version (on the reading we are
considering), the Puritanical Adonis awaits the rapture to be physically transmuted; the Gnostic
Venus seeks spiritual transmutation in the here and now. The poet-alchemist tries to create a
“mystical union between man and woman, the human and the divine, and the desirer and
desired” to restore “that which is fallen” (Adonis has fallen from his ‘sun god’ status through
Puritanism, and Venus has fallen from the celestial Neoplatonic form of Love which she
instantiates on earth to try to save him through Gnosis) to its “primary beauty, excellence and
perfection” (hence the Gnostic Venus calling attention to the “beauty, excellence and perfection”
latent in Adonis at the poem’s very inception, 7-12).

To be sure, I am not using these evidences (of which there are myriads more) to prove my
reading. Rather, I will use my close sequential reading of the poem to show that Shakespeare’s
Venus and Adonis may be profitably read as one such ‘Gnostic’ ‘veil of colors.’
The Gnostic Law of Reversal
Because Hughes neglects to do the close readings required to substantiate his position, I
have therefore had to discover the following patterns in the poem myself. Crucially, the Biblical
literalist claims the “god of this world”198 employs the satanic law of reversal to flip the truth
upside-down,199 getting Gnostics to “speak evil of good, and good of evil,” “put darkness for
light, and light for darkness,” “bitter for sweet, and sweet for sour,” to make them “wise in their
own eyes, and prudent in their own sight,” and “justify the wicked for a reward, and take away
the righteousness of the righteous from him.”200 Venus may be read as employing this Gnostic
law of reversal to speak evil of Adonis’s goodness throughout the poem (to take away his
righteousness from him), as when she renders his abstinence an endless litany of Biblical sins.

198 2 Corinthians 4:4 GNV. See Irenaeus, Against Heresies.
199 Isaiah 29:16 KJV. The Jesus of the broadly ‘Gnostic’ Coptic Gospel of Thomas enunciates the
law of reversal at line 22: “When you make the two one, and when you make the inside like the
outside and the outside like the inside, and the above like the below, and when you make the
male and the female one and the same, so that the male not be male nor the female female; and
when you fashion eyes in the place of an eye, and a hand in place of a hand, and a foot in place
of a foot, and a likeness in place of a likeness; then will you enter the kingdom.” The Jesus of the
Bible is a sham Christ for the Gnostic; this Gnostic Jesus is a Luciferian deception for the
Puritan. In The Gospel of Thomas: Annotated & Explained (Skylight Illuminations, 2002),
Stevan Davies argues that this apocryphal Gospel is, strictly speaking, not Gnostic in the
narrowest sense. It is, however, representative of the mystical, secret teachings which the broadly
‘Gnostic’ (esoteric knowledge-seeking) syncretist would incorporate into his or her synthesis and
a text which the ‘Puritan’ would reject as an extracanonical Luciferian deception.
200 Isaiah 5:20-24 GNV.
Jennings 52
The poet may also be read as employing this Gnostic law of reversal himself when he subverts
Biblical parables, injunctions, and doctrines (not always through Venus’s lips).
From the perspective of each hermeneutical tendency, the other one flips the truth upsidedown. As Hulse observes, the answer Venus gives to the question ‘Why does beauty wither?’ (to
which Adonis would give the answer, ‘Because of sin’) is that “Diana, goddess of chastity and
narcissism, is to blame and love is the force that preserves”201 (where Diana is a mirror for
Adonis, 733-38). From the Puritan’s perspective, Adonis’s perseverance in chastity may be
understood as righteous rejection of Gnostic illumination through carnal knowledge. From the
Gnostic perspective, Adonis misperceives esoteric wisdom as carnal knowledge and Gnostic
illumination as devil possession (his narcissistic chastity, not sin, is to blame for beauty’s
transience). Thus for the Puritan, given that abstinence is virtuous in the Bible,202 Venus is
speaking “evil” of Adonis’s goodness (see the above paragraph),203 when she renders his
abstinence a sin tantamount to: i) narcissistic pride (157-162, 761-762),204 ii) refusal to
acknowledge and adhere to one’s nature as it was created by God (163-168, 385-386),205 iii)
selfish neglect of the Biblical principle of reciprocity (167-168, 169-174, 203-204, 369-372),206
iv) destructive repression of natural impulse (“Affection is a coal that must be cooled,/Else,
suffered, it will set the heart on fire,” 387-388), v) self-enslavement (by implication, 391-392),

vi) suicide (127-132, 763, 765),207 vii) robbery (where “steel” is a pun for “steal,” 375),208 and
even viii) murder (playfully, 499-503; seriously, 757-762; specifically, infanticide, 766).209
That is, through the Gnostic (satanic) law of reversal, Venus renders Adonis’s Biblically
virtuous abstinence the Biblical sin of narcissistic pride210 (which leads to the Biblical sin of
suicide;211 that is, the sin of slaying the very image of God),212 with the dual implication that his
chastity is a cover for the Biblical sin of masturbation,213 at 157-162:
‘Is thine own heart to thine own face affected?
Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?
Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected;
Steal thine own freedom, and complain on theft.
 Narcissus so himself himself forsook,
 And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.’ (157-162)
Moreover, Venus has just promised her burden to be light as Christ claims his to be (155-156),214
and here she subversively evokes Christ’s command to the alms-giver not to let his “left hand
know” what his “right hand doeth” (“Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?” 158).215

207 Only wicked men, apart from Saul’s armor-bearer (about whose character we are told
nothing, 1 Samuel 34:1-6 GNV) are depicted committing suicide: Abimelech (Judges 9:54

Seizing connotes theft, and theft is the inverse of alms-giving. This sets up her accusation that
Adonis’s narcissistic pride (the supposed symptom and cause of his Puritanism) is the thief who
robs his own freedom, which theft she mockingly instructs him to “complain on” (160).
By being chaste (which St. Paul recommends as a holier option than marriage),216 Adonis is,
according to the Gnostic Venus, ‘burying’ his “posterity” (758) in the “swallowing grave” that is
his “body” (757); he is ‘destroying’ his would-be progeny in “dark obscurity” (760), the
consequence of which being that the “world will hold” him in “disdain/Sith in [his] pride so fair
a hope is slain” (my emphasis, 761-762).
Through the Gnostic (satanic) law of reversal, Venus renders Adonis’s Biblically virtuous
abstinence the Biblical sin of refusing to adhere to his nature as it was created by God,217 when
she sermonizes on the purpose of things and the neglect of those purposes (“Torches are made to
light, jewels to wear,/Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,/Herbs for their smell, and sappy
plants to bear./Things growing to themselves are growth’s abuse,” 163-166). She does the same
when she compares him to his “palfrey,” who, “as he should” (and as Adonis should)
“Welcomes” (as Adonis does not) “the warm approach of sweet desire” (385-386). Through this
same Gnostic law of reversal, Venus renders Adonis’s Biblically virtuous abstinence the Biblical
sin of selfishly neglecting the Golden Rule (Do unto others as you would have them do unto
you)
218 when she argues, “Seeds spring from seeds, and beauty breedeth beauty:/Thou wast
begot; to get it is thy duty” (167-168). She does the same when she rhetorically asks, “Upon the
earth’s increase why shouldst thou feed/Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?” (169-170).

216 See 1 Corinthians 7 GNV.
217 1 Corinthians 11:14 GNV; Romans 1:26 GNV.

Jennings 55
According to Venus, it is the Gnostic (her) and not the Puritan (Adonis) who is really abiding by
the Golden Rule. She makes this clear when she claims,
‘Would thou wert as I am, and I a man,
My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound;
For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,
Though nothing but my body’s bane would cure thee.’ (369-372)
According to Venus, by abstaining from sexual intercourse with her (by rejecting Gnostic
illumination through esoteric knowledge), Adonis is, just as his horse was before it emancipated
itself through love, “Servilely mastered with a leathern rein” (392), rather than ‘free from sin,’ as
the ‘Puritanical’ God of the Bible would have it.219 Through the Gnostic law of reversal, she
renders his Biblically virtuous chastity the Biblical sin of suicide when she argues, “Beauty
within itself should not be wasted./Fair flowers that are not gathered in their prime/Rot, and
consume themselves in little time,” 130-132). She does the same when she concludes that
through his perseverance in chastity he ‘himself’ is ‘in himself’ “made away” (763), and that his
“mischief” is “worse than . . . theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay” (764-765). At
375, Venus accuses the Biblically virtuous Adonis of ‘steeling’ (hardening) his as well as her
heart, where “steel” may be read as a pun for “steal,” thereby rendering his abstinence the
Biblical sin of robbery.220 Venus will even go so far as to render Adonis’s chastity the Biblical
sin of murder,221 first playfully (“O, thou didst kill me; kill me once again!” 499), then seriously
(“Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain,” my emphasis, 762), before specifically rendering it

Jennings 56
infanticide when she calls it a “mischief worse than” that of a “butcher sire that reaves his son of
life” (763-765).
Venus also renders Adonis’s abstinence sinful via this Gnostic law of reversal when she
ix) paronomastically emasculates him as inhumane (“Thing like a man, but of no woman bred,”
214), which she does while x) flipping the Protestant Adonis’s accusations of Catholic idolatry
on him to render the chaste Adonis a self-revering idol (211-216).222 That is, she exploits the
dual meaning of the phrase “like a man” (like a real manly man/like a human being with a heart)
to render Adonis’s Biblically virtuous chastity simultaneously self-emasculating and inhumane,
both of which are, for the Biblical literalist, sins: for the Puritan, men are to be men, not
women;223 and human beings are to be human beings with hearts, not soulless monsters.224 She
also renders his abstinence a sin via this method when she xi) ascribes to him the hardheartedness of the unredeemed (“O, give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it,” 375).225 Here she
even evokes Adonai’s controversial hardening of Pharaoh’s heart when she absurdly imagines
Adonis’s continued chastity as causing Love’s goddess to lose regard for love’s groans,226 in the
devastating couplet “Then love’s deep groans I never shall regard,/Because Adonis’ heart hath
made mine hard” (377-378). That is, the Biblical God is said to have hardened Pharaoh’s heart in
Exodus 9:12, which implies, for those unsympathetic to the Biblical God (such as the Gnostics),
an infringement on human freedom. To harden one’s heart to God is to damn oneself to eternal
torment.227 So the argument goes, while it makes sense that one who hardens one’s heart to God

might be denied salvation, it seems problematic that God should harden people’s hearts to him to
render them irredeemable while they are still living. With dual irony, Venus evokes this
hardening of Pharaoh’s heart by attributing a comparable act to Adonis, where it is his hard heart
that hardens hers. In the same way that Adonis will, in some lines, be Neoplatonic Beauty itself,
here Adonis in some sense is the ‘Puritanical’ Goddess-repressing God of the Bible Himself: so
long as he heeds the Biblical call to chastity, he is His very heart-hardening manifestation on
earth.
Venus often inverts Biblical injunctions, parables, and doctrines to render the Puritanical
Adonis a hypocrite. For example, she renders him the idle servant who accuses his master (who
represents God) of usury in the Parable of the Talents (“Foul cank’ring rust the hidden treasure
frets,/But gold that’s put to use more gold begets,” 767-768).228 In the Parable, the idle servant is
given one talent (here a gold coin) and instructed to put it to good use. Being the idler he is, he
buries it. The master’s other servants, all of whom were given more than him at the outset,
double the money they were given. The idler alone returns with no gains. He ‘explains’ himself
via accusing his master of usury. The implication is that God gives each of us certain “talents”
(which serves as a metaphor as well as a pun for gifts), and though he gives some people more
than others, we are all to put them to good use. Here Adonis is the one who refuses to, as it were,
“put to use” the “gold” God gave him in order to beget more. Chastity is a virtue in the Bible but
Venus here employs the Gnostic (satanic) law of reversal to render it idleness (the Biblical sin of
slothfulness).229

By employing the Gnostic law of reversal, Venus will even invert Christ in her own
person, when she says, “Love keeps his revels where there are but twain” (123)—a subversive
echo of Christ’s claim to be wherever two or three are gathered in his name.230 She will even
invert Christ’s teaching on the rapture via the Gnostic law of reversal when she flips the Parable
of the Ten Virgins to render the wise ones foolish and the foolish ones wise:231
‘Therefore, despite of fruitless chastity,
Love-lacking vestals and self-loving nuns,
That on the earth would breed a scarcity
And barren dearth of daughters and of sons,
 Be prodigal. The lamp that burns by night
 Dries up his oil to lend the world his light. (751-756)
In the original Parable, it is the five Virgins who are actually virgins (those who have purged
themselves of worldliness and are prepared for the return of their master Christ) who are
rewarded with salvation for having “oil” in their “lamps” at his coming (presumably the Holy
Spirit in their hearts). It is the five Virgins who are not actually virgins (those who are worldly
and not prepared for the return of their master) who are condemned for lacking “oil” in their
“lamps” (lacking the Holy Spirit in their hearts). By a startling inversion, here it is ‘prodigality’
that is praised (755). Here it is noble to burn one’s lamp by night (in romance), to dry up one’s
“oil” (expend one’s spirit in what is for Venus not a waste of shame), and “lend the world” the
“light” of one’s progeny (756).

The poet has his fair share in this Gnostic subversion. For example, he daringly evokes
the Golden Rule with bawdy irony in the line “Backward she pushed him, as she would be
thrust” (41), wherein Venus does unto Adonis as she would have him do unto her.232 And he
evokes the woeful cry of Jesus on the cross, who is said to be God manifest in the flesh,233 “My
God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”234 in the line “She’s Love; she loves; and yet she is
not loved” (610), wherein Venus, Love manifest in the flesh, has been forsaken by Love. Here,
as throughout the poem, the poet exploits Venus’s status as Love manifest in the flesh to
subversively examine the Biblical literalist’s doctrine that Jesus Christ was himself God manifest
in the flesh.235
The Gnostic views Puritanism’s anathematization of the invisible world (its suppression
of the unconscious, of which the libido is a crucial subset) as profane. The Gnostic therefore
views Puritanism’s repression of sexuality as unnatural and wicked. Thus, the most obvious level
on which this Gnostic subversion functions (the erotic level) is consistent with what I might call
the poem’s most crucial layer (its deeper, purely theosophical level). The erotic level may even
be said to supervene upon this purely theosophical level. But given that Venus’s romantic
solicitations function (on this deeper level) as a sales-pitch for Gnosis, Venus is ultimately
rendering Adonis’s Biblically righteous rejection of self-deification through esoteric knowledge
an atrocity synonymous with this endless litany of Biblical sins.
Keeping the poem’s pervasive employment of the Gnostic of law of reversal in mind, let
us now turn to my close sequential reading of the poem’s first 204 lines.

CHAPTER TWO: SALESWOMAN OF GNOSIS
This chapter is composed of four sections. I have broken up the poem’s first 204 lines
into its key episodes to make my close sequential reading of the poem via Mortimer’s Variable
Passions as clear as possible. Because Hughes’s reading is anything but close and anything but
sequential, to offer anything but a close sequential reading of the poem to validate its
‘Puritanical-Gnostic hermeneutical tendency’ extension as a fruitful model would be to cause
more confusion than Hughes’s book (and the poem itself) has already engendered. As we have
seen, critics who, in proper scholarly fashion, have amassed evidence from throughout the poem
to prove a certain point have not adequately taken into consideration which perspective each line
in the poem is representing. It is by attending to the poem’s perspectival shifts in sequential
fashion—by allowing the poem to present its ambivalences to us as they sequentially unfold
themselves—that my proposal may be, first and foremost, clearly understood, and secondly,
validated as a profitable reading model. I will start with Venus’s approach, which is the Gnostic
Sophia’s approach to the Puritan (1-24). Here especially the poem’s appropriation of
Hermeticism is made evident. I will then look at Venus’s physical aggression in detail, which
signifies the way the Gnostic Goddess manifests for the Puritan who rejects her (25-90). I will
then proceed to the Mars episode which reveals, through Venus’s expurgated version of her
affair with the war god, her recognition that her beloved is a Puritan (91-114). The episode
further captures the distinction between i) Venus’s Gnostic project of synthesizing the masculine
with the feminine and the ii) Puritanical Adonis’s perception of her syncretic project as an
emasculating threat. I will then look at Venus’s Horatian argument in detail which forges a
distinction between the i) Gnostic Venus’s desire for immediate spiritual transformation through
esoteric knowledge in the here and now, and the ii) Puritanical Adonis’s desire for physical
Jennings 61
metamorphosis at the resurrection which is to be attained through patient perseverance in
chastity (115-174). Here also I will look at Adonis insofar as he is the potential sun god, the
potential Christ, the potential “Aeon Jesus” who holds the key to Sophia’s (and his own)
salvation. Through the realization of the “Aeon Jesus” latent within Adonis, the Sophianic Venus
may be saved from the world whose author and prisoner she has unintentionally become (175-
204). Here especially the poem’s syncretic appropriation of Neoplatonism is clarified. This
Chapter is called “Saleswoman of Gnosis” because it reads the first 204 lines of the poem
primarily as the Gnostic Sophia’s sales-pitch to the Puritan who rejects her.

 The Gnostic Sophia’s Approach to the Puritan
The first stanza presents, in Coleridge’s words, the “whole argument of the poem,”236 and
thus it may be said to present the antithetical structure between Puritanism and Gnosticism which
it will consistently reinforce:
Even as the sun with purple-coloured face,
Had ta’en his last leave of the weeping morn,
Rose-cheeked Adonis hied him to the chase.
Hunting he loved, but love he laughed to scorn.
 Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,
 And like a bold-faced suitor ’gins to woo him. (1-6)
The Hermetic quality of the world we are invited to enter, the astrological correspondence
between the heavens above and the things of this earth, the divinity latent within Adonis, the
hypocrisy in his Puritanical—and therefore paradoxically impassioned—rejection of the

236 Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Shakespearean Criticism, Vol. 1 (Dent, 1960), 192-193.
Jennings 62
alchemist-poet’s Neoplatonic Love, the subjection of the Love Goddess’s ontology to the whims
of his Puritanical ‘misperception,’ and the irony of her being the representative of the
Neoplatonic form of Love at the same time as she is its love-sick instantiation, are all visibly
brought to the fore at the poem’s very inception.
The poet immediately identifies Adonis with the sun in three ways: i) his rosy cheeks are
comparable to, albeit contrasted with, the sun’s “purple-coloured face” (1, 3); ii) his hurrying “to
the chase” is suggested as being temporally and therefore supernaturally linked with the sun’s
taking “his last leave of the weeping morn” (2); and iii) the sun is subtly introduced as that
higher, divine aspect of the terrestrial Adonis who, though himself a god, has here been brought
down to earth and clothed in quite human flesh, as if he were a demi-god caught between heaven
and earth. The “weeping morn” is Aurora (2), “goddess of the dawn,” who “weeps tears of dew
when forsaken each morning by her lover, the sun,”237 with whom Venus is to be identified. Both
Venus and Adonis hurry themselves “to the chase” (3), only they hunt after different things:
Adonis hunts after the boar, Venus after Adonis.
That “Even as” is at once a temporal comparison—“[while] the sun with purple-coloured
face/Had ta’en his last leave of the weeping morn,/Rose-cheeked Adonis hied him to the chase”
(1-3)—and a non-temporal comparison—“[in the same way that] the sun with purple-coloured
face/Had ta’en his last leave of the weeping morn,/Rose-cheeked Adonis hied him to the chase”
(1-3). Thus we have the Hermetic motto “as above, so below” depicted right from the start:
238 in
the world of Venus and Adonis, events on earth are mirrored in heaven; they even occur at the
same time. Mortimer observes:

237 Norton, 635.
238 Healy, 16.
Jennings 63
The implied comparison between Adonis and the sun (which Venus will render
explicit, 197-98, 863-64) involves a subtle blend of similarity and difference: purple
and rose, though close in the spectrum, are opposed in their respective connotations
of inflamed passion and blushing innocence; the sun’s leavetaking of the “weeping
morn” at daybreak anticipates Adonis’ departure from the weeping Venus at
nightfall, but the sun will return and Adonis will not.239
A binary red-white colour scheme pervades the poem,240 and yet there are a few notable
exceptions to the otherwise unbreakable law which dictates everything must needs be red or
white: the sun begins as “purple” (1), the mute flowers “whereon” they “lean” are “violets” (125-
126), the “painted grapes” of Zeuxis are presumably purple (601-604), and Adonis will notably
be transformed upon his death into a “purple flower . . . chequered with white” (1118). The
purple may therefore be understood as signifying that which is above them (the sun), below them
(the violets), and beyond them (the purple flower that lies beyond the grave), and therefore
generally what is beyond reach (the purple grapes of Zeuxis). Given purple may signify majesty
(and by extension divinity), divinity may be understood as something, at least at present, beyond
Adonis’s reach—what is for him divinity’s counterfeit, which though above him (like the sun),
he sees as beneath him (like the violets, into whose resemblance he is nevertheless fated to
metamorphose).
The key line of this stanza is “Hunting he loved, but love he laughed to scorn” (4).
Mortimer notes that the “rhetorical neatness” of the line, “with its polyptoton”—the repetition of

Jennings 64
love in “loved” and “love”—“and paronomasia”—homophonic play on “loved” and “laughed”—
“prepares us for the clipped, self-sufficient and categorical quality that will be typical of Adonis
when he speaks for himself, but it also initiates the poem’s complex play of antithesis and
analogy between hunting and love, and hints at the reversal by which the youth who loves to
hunt will be hunted by love.”
241 But the line may be understood as doing much more than this.
The poet, as spiritual alchemist, may be understood as exposing the Puritanical Adonis’s
hypocrisy here: the second “love” of the line, which Adonis laughs to scorn, may be understood
as Neoplatonic Love, the very Form of Love, and the first “loved” his instantiation of it—his
instantiation of the very thing he is mockingly rejecting. So sayeth the Neoplatonist, ‘one cannot
hate love and love hunting.’ This argument sounds sophistical—it sounds like the poet is
playfully adopting the role of sophist, and the comical thrust of the poem would suggest there is
something to be said for this reading242—but notwithstanding the equivocation on the word
“love,” from the Neoplatonic perspective it is actually sound. With dual irony, the phrase
“laughed to scorn” further reinforces the hypocrisy: “laughed” sounds like “loved” at the same
time as it carries with it a Biblical echo of that scornful Pharisaical laughter to which Christ
himself was subjected (“And they laughed him to scorn”).
243 That is, the homophonic play on
“laughed” allows for the alternative reading, ‘Hunting he loved, but love he loved to scorn’ (4).
With this addition, Adonis is to be understood as one who not only i) instantiates the Neoplatonic
form of Love in the same sentence in which he rejects it, but one who further ii) instantiates it in
the very act of scorning it. The Puritanical Adonis is hereby rendered a Pharisee for rejecting

241 Mortimer, 38.
242 See Putney.
243 Matthew 9:24; Mark 5:40; Luke 8:53 GNV.
Jennings 65
Love, which the Bible says God is.
244 As the Biblical Christ was subjected to scornful Pharisaical
laughter, so here the Gnostic’s syncretic “Love-Christ” is subjected to scornful Puritanical
laughter.245 The poet hereby employs the Gnostic (satanic) law of reversal to invert the Biblical
Christ of the Puritan into the syncretic “Love-Christ” of the Gnostic,246 whereby those who
worship the first and reject the second are rendered philosophically incoherent.
Mortimer then writes that “as we move from the face of the sun and the cheeks of Adonis
to the countenance of the goddess, an antithetical pair of compound adjectives, ‘sick-thoughted’
and ‘bold-faced,’ warns us that the rhetoric of Venus, however superficially exuberant, will be
generated more by anxiety than self-confidence.”
247 That epithet “Sick-thoughted” is surely
meant to suggest love-sickness, an ironic epithet for the Goddess of Love. But it may also
suggest the Puritanical Adonis’s paranoid ‘misperception’ of the thoughts within Venus’s skull.
As Catherine Belsey writes,
In Shakespeare’s narrative poem the goddess of love, traditional object of all men’s
admiration, unexpectedly appears as a desiring subject, herself at the mercy of an
intractable passion. Led by experience to expect the devotion of others and
accustomed to master, imprison, and enslave her lovers (ll. 101-12), Venus is here
reduced to the role of suitor (l. 6) overpowered by another’s beauty and subject in her
turn to indifference and disdain.248
At the mythic level, Venus, in her capacity as the Gnostic Sophia, has ended up imprisoned in a

world she has accidentally created. She seeks her salvation in the Sacred Bridegroom that is the
“Aeon Jesus” latent within Adonis.249 In the very beginning of things, he was her other half, her
divine consort, but he is here reduced through Puritanism to the Jaldabaoth who can only
misperceive her.250 In her capacity as the Love Goddess, she is a heavenly deity to be adored by
earthly beings, but she is here reduced to a love-sick whore who deifies a man. To avail
ourselves of Mortimer’s insight, but to draw a connection between this “antithetical pair of
compound adjectives” in another way,251 we might say it alerts us to the fact that Adonis sees a
bold face and behind that bold face the sick and twisted thoughts of a devil. The suggestion may
be that, if one sees the very Goddess of Love as “sick-thoughted,” there is something wrong, not
with her, but with her percipient; the argument being that Puritanism corrupts Love to the extent
of rendering love-sick the earthly manifestation of its very celestial form. On this reading, we are
to understand the Puritanical Adonis’s boar-hunt as a witch-hunt: he has turned Neoplatonic
Love (something heavenly) into a boar (something animalistic and infernal) in order to hunt it, as
the Biblical literalist renders the Goddess a devil to be extirpated and the Gnostic adept a witch
to be burned.
The second stanza of Venus and Adonis captures the ‘alchemical’ thrust of the poem:
‘Thrice fairer than myself,’ thus she began,
‘The fields’ chief flower, sweet above compare,
Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,
More white and red than doves or roses are—
 Nature that made thee with herself at strife

251 Mortimer, 38.
Jennings 67
 Saith that the world hath ending with thy life. (7-12)
While Mortimer will write of Venus, “Variable passions throng her constant woe” (967) to
describe the “combination of fear, despair, revolt and incredulity with which she reacts to the
first (inconclusive) evidence that Adonis has been killed,”252 he sees the phrase “Variable
passions” as an “apt way to describe not only the grief of Venus, but her situation from the very
beginning of the poem where her first address to Adonis suggests the plurality of desires that she
can bring to bear on a single object.”253 Mortimer fittingly sees the crucial phrase “More lovely
than a man” as readable on three levels: “i) more lovely than a mortal, ii) more lovely than an
adult male; (iii) more lovely than the male sex.”254 He sees Venus’s love as “triply transgressive:
transgressive of the cosmic hierarchy by overstepping the bounds between human and divine;
transgressive of the generational order because it is the sexual desire of an adult for a child;
transgressive of established gender roles because it involves female desire for an essentially
feminine beauty.”255 In a word, her desire is transgressive of the Puritanical order. As Fienberg’s
feminist reading would have it, Venus “suggests a liberating reevaluation of the patriarchal world
she both plays in and subverts, as she demonstrates the usefulness of the thematics of value to
expose the limitations of absolutist perspectives.”256 Venus comes on the scene disrupting three
different binaries at once, presenting herself to Adonis as the Hermetic Corpus, the Gnostic
apocrypha, and early modern alchemical texts present themselves to the Puritan. That her desire
should be “triply” transgressive is all too apt as, on this reading, the phrase “Thrice fairer than
myself” (7) may be read, on one level, as suggesting Adonis has the Goddess’s feminine beauty

as well as the masculine (and child-like) beauty she lacks. On another level, it calls attention to
the threefold nature of man (that he is body, soul, and spirit; a potential beast and a potential
angel, but presently a man) with the suggestion that, if he, a man, is thrice as great as a divine
being in at least one way, he may be (or become) greater than her in other ways. On yet another
level, the Sophianic level, it calls attention to the fact that Adonis is female to the extent that he
is the same person as Venus. He was her other half in the very beginning of things.257 Moreover,
for the Gnostic, he is the child of Venus in the same sense in which the demiurge Jaldabaoth is
the child of Sophia.258 The phrase additionally evokes, for the astute reader, the divine Hermes
Trismegistus, who is said to be “thrice-great”—a reincarnation of whom Adonis is destined to
become, but whose esoteric truths he is fated to eschew:
259 he is to trade in his Puritanical boarspear for a Hermetic caduceus, but, rejecting the latter, he will fatally cling to the former.
Heather Dubrow would have us see Venus’s behaviour in lines 7-19 as “self-centered and
self-serving.”260 For Dubrow, when Venus uses the phrase “Thrice fairer than myself” (7), “she
is really lauding her own beauty even while seemingly concentrating on his, presenting herself as
the measure of all loveliness.”261 But if we understand Venus to be manifesting as she does in
consequence of the way in which the Puritanical Adonis ‘misperceives’ her (as Hughes would
have it), an additional layer of the poem is opened up to us and its apparent ambivalences
accounted for. It is consistent with Hughes’s reading that Venus’s promises and demands should
persistently manifest themselves throughout the poem as incoherent and self-defeating. Venus is
constantly wanting it both ways, which captures at once the i) spiritual alchemist’s desire to

Jennings 69
synthesize all ostensibly mutually exclusive antitheses,262 and the ii) Puritan’s refusal to see
“productive fusion” in her “troubling divisions and incompatible binaries,” as Healy claims we
moderns, “peering” into Shakespeare’s more enigmatic lines “through our post-Cartesian
lenses,” are unable to do.263 In short, Venus’s arguments appear to Adonis as the Hermetic
Corpus, the Gnostic apocrypha, and the early modern alchemical texts read to the Puritan—as the
offer of Gnosis appears to the Biblical literalist.
Consistent with my Puritanical-Gnostic model is Mortimer’s observation that Adonis sees
a “threat posed by the sheer profusion and incoherence of [Venus’s] persuasions”264—the “love
proposed by Venus appears so protean and so unstable, so much all and therefore nothing, that it
can only threaten to dissolve rather than define the fragile identity of a youth who pleads ‘Before
I know myself seek not to know me’ (525).”265 Equally apropos is his observation that
It is the complexities of Venus’ own desire, her “variable passions” (967), that
most radically undermine her plea for natural simplicity. If nature dictates mutual
attraction between the sexes, what are we to make of the fact that Venus is
attracted to Adonis by his feminine qualities (“Stain to all nymphs, more lovely
than a man,” 9)? If sexual intercourse is, as she argues, the fruit of maturity, how
do we take her own admission that she wishes to taste Adonis while he is still
“unripe” (127-128)? And, if it is an initiation into manhood, how does this fit with
her repeated attempts to reduce him to the level of a child to be tempted with

265 Mortimer, 29.
Jennings 70
“honey secrets” and protected from the dangerous world by the playpen of a
maternal body?266
We have already seen how the “sheer profusion and incoherence” of Venus’s protean
“persuasions” may be understood at the Sophianic level.267 She is seeking the Sacred
Bridegroom who is to rescue her from a world whose author and prisoner she has accidentally
become. She is seeking him in Adonis who is, at the same time, her son Jaldabaoth, for Adonis
has become the Puritanical demiurge he worships—the false God of the Biblical literalist who
has taken over her creation, imprisoned her within it, and anathematized her as a diabolical
whore.268 On the Hermetic level (recall that Hermeticism is a crucial aspect of the confluence I
am calling Gnosticism), her approach to Adonis is Hermes Trismegistus’s sales-pitch to the
Puritan. The reason it does not work on him is he views her syntheses as incoherent and her
idealism as vain flattery. She functions as an embodiment of these Hermetic alchemical texts that
encourage man to see himself, as he presently is, as “the field’s chief flower, sweet above
compare” (8), rather than as an irredeemably evil worm in need of a permanent makeover, as the
Puritanical God would have it. These texts, in sharp contrast to Biblical literalism, promise
divinity to man in the here and now, encourage an outlook of freedom without restriction, and
embolden its reader to become all he may imagine himself to be. This, for the Puritanical
Adonis, is Luciferian pride. She is selling the philosopher’s stone to Adonis; she is promising
him the elixir of life; she is calling upon the muses to grant her the eloquence to express to
Adonis his divine potential; she is trying to get him to revoke Puritanism and join her secret
society dedicated to the realization of his own inner deity, none of which interests him. Her

Jennings 71
urgency is best explained on the Sophianic level: to save herself, the Goddess must save Adonis
from the Jaldabaoth he has already become; and to save himself he must save the Goddess, for
on the mythic plane they are one and the same.
Moreover, the Petrarchan phrase, “More white and red than doves or roses are” (10), as
well as praising man’s beauty—and by implication, his supremacy over all things—is an
example of alchemical conjunction, which fittingly evokes, through its alchemically labile
construction, the “Red Man and his White Wife” whom the alchemist’s magnum opus is
dedicated to marrying.269 The alchemically labile sentence serves as a contraction of two
clauses—‘More white than doves are and more red than roses are,’ but where the comparison of
the “and” with the “or” results in what is productive alchemical fusion to the syncretic Gnostic
but vain confusion to the Puritanical Adonis. This alchemical conjunction fittingly follows the
attempted synthesis of Adonis’s male and female attributes, evoking the “hermaphrodite” which
the alchemist’s magnum opus is designed to produce,270 and which Adonis’s Puritanism will
keep him from becoming. Harwood confirms the “hermaphrodite” to be a “favourite Neoplatonic
image” and argues the ostensibly-but-not-quite-consummated hermaphrodite in Spenser’s Faerie
Queene III.xii.46 inspired Shakespeare’s near-incorporation of Venus and Adonis into one.271
Loraine Fletcher writes that “[a]n environmentalist reading might suggest that if we ignore our
kinship with the animals as Adonis does, if we see them as merely food, the food will strike
back.”272 On my theosophical reading, we might say that, for refusing to become the spiritual

Jennings 72
Hermaphrodite of the syncretic Gnostic, Adonis is, with ‘savage irony’ (as Price would put it),273
fatally castrated by one. By a mortal wound to the groin, he is slain by the boar, whose
“peculiarly hermaphroditic nature” is “almost universally recognized in mythology”274—a
hermaphrodite comprising what Hughes calls the rival brother (Mars, 97-114) and the infernal
aspect of Venus.275 As Mortimer observes,
The hermaphrodite figure is particularly relevant to Venus and Adonis because
we already think of both protagonists in bisexual terms—Adonis as a hunter, proud
of his male autonomy and yet feminine in his beauty and virginally fearful of sexual
invasion; Venus as a woman inviting penetration, yet attracted by a beauty that, with
its enticing hollows, casts her in the male role. What could be more fitting than that
one doubly sexual identity should replace two split sexual identities and that sexual
fusion should be the answer to sexual confusion.276
Peter Dow Webster, emphasizing the boar’s distinctively masculine traits, even sees the
creature as the castrating “archetypal primal father,”277 as figured, we might add, by a poet
inclined to the ‘Gnostic’ tendency. James Schiffer’s Lacanian reading even understands the boar
as the “Name-of-the-Father, representative of the symbolic order, the Other (as locus of
signification), the Law.”278 William E. Sheidley also corroborates this reading when he contends
the boar to be “the locus of [Adonis’] missing phallic impulse,”279 the “return,” as Schiffer puts

it, “in objective form of what Adonis has repressed.”280 For the Gnostic, Adonis’s Puritanical
anathematization of the invisible world (his repression of the unconscious, of which the libido is
a crucial subset) inevitably manifests as one’s own murderer. That is, on the deepest level,
Adonis’s Puritanical repression of sexuality symbolizes more broadly Puritanism’s
anathematization of the hidden world which Gnosticism is committed to exploring—the hidden
world of the unconscious, the dream-world that is the visual imagination, the invisible world of
abstract principles which undergirds all of visible nature. The poem suggests that to anathematize
one’s own unconscious, to repress one’s visual imagination, to render nature deaf and mute is to
slay one’s very own soul.
Not only this, but line 10 simultaneously evokes the commandment of the Biblical Christ
(what is, for the Gnostic, the sham Christ): “be ye therefore wise as serpents, and innocent as
doves.”281 The Biblical Christ commands Christians to be wise as something that is evil, yet
innocent as something that is harmless (one is to be knowledgeable of the devices of the devil so
as not to be corrupted by them; one is to know how they are employed but avoid employing them
oneself). Venus praises man (Adonis) for what he already is: simultaneously more white than the
whitest thing there is (doves) and more red than the reddest thing there is (roses). Her claim (like
Christ’s commandment) is presented in the form of a paradox: how can one be wise as a serpent
and innocent as a dove? (Surely if one lacks the slyness of the serpent, one cannot be as wise as
one); and how can one be more white than doves are and more red than roses are? (Surely if one
is both, one is neither.) For Venus, Adonis does not need to be told, ‘Be innocent as doves’; he is
already whiter than them. He simply needs to realize the fact. That is, for the Gnostic, man

281 Matthew 10:16 GNV.
Jennings 74
(Adonis) does not need to be told what to do (by the Puritanical God); rather, he needs to realize
the supreme beauty (divinity) already latent within him. Furthermore, the phrase ‘more white
than doves are,’ echoing as it does Mathew 10:16, may suggest that Adonis is more innocent
than even doves are (rather than inherently irredeemable, as the Puritanical God would have it).
In this case, the word “red” in the phrase ‘more red than roses are,’ would align itself with the
word “wise” in Matthew 10:16, and the word “roses” with Matthew 10:16’s “serpents.” Thus the
“red,” associated as it is with carnal passion, and aligning itself as it does with the wisdom of
serpents in Matthew 10:16, may therefore suggest the ‘serpentine wisdom’ of the Gnostic which
is viewed by the Puritan as carnal knowledge. For Adonis, the serpentine wisdom of the Gnostic
is antithetical to the white dove-like innocence of Puritanism, but for Venus (the Gnostic
Sophia), they are not diametrically opposed. On his view, he is to be wise to her devilish devices,
that he may remain unblemished by them. For her, he may illuminate himself through Gnosis
and remain innocent in the process.282
Venus’s anti-Puritanical ennoblement of humanity is evocative of the ‘damnably
heretical’ Emerald Tablet whose “first precept states, ‘That which is above is like to that which is
below, and that which is below is like to that which is above, to accomplish the miracles of one
thing.’”
283 The poem precisely enacts this above-below correspondence (1-3) and suggests it via
the heavenly Venus’s likeness with the earthly Adonis. She, a celestial Goddess (the heavenly
Neoplatonic form of Love) is, if anything, more ‘anthropomorphic’ (more human in her
emotional expression) than the earthly Adonis. The elusive “miracles of one thing” to be
accomplished are the miracles of the alchemical mystery whereby Venus (and the vast system of

282 See Irenaeus, Ch. VI for a Church Father’s perception of this Gnostic view. According to him,
Gnostics viewed themselves as immune from the Biblical God’s judgment.

Jennings 75
correspondences she embodies—Neoplatonic Love, Roman Catholicism, paganism, femininity,
Sophianic Gnosis) is to be married with Adonis (Neoplatonic Beauty, Protestantism, Biblical
literalism, masculinity, the Puritanical Goddess-repressing God) to produce the alchemical
“hermaphrodite” of oneness,284 whereby Sophia and the “Aeon Jesus” may return to their
original matrimonial state. The Emerald Tablet’s second precept “talks of ‘the contemplation of
one’” (that is, Venus’s transgression of binaries to render such oppositions as male and female,
divinity and humanity, and red and white ‘one thing’).285 Another of its precepts “promises,
‘Thus thou wilt possess the glory of the brightness of the whole world, and all obscurity will fly
far from thee.’”
286 This grandiloquence is mirrored in Venus’s assessment that Adonis’s beauty
is thrice that of the very Goddess of Love (7) and stains that of all women (divine ones included)
by comparison (9). He is more lovely than humankind as conventionally conceived by the
Puritan (9). He is “sweet above compare” with anything in the universe (8). He is more “white”
than “doves,” more “red” than “roses” (10)—in a word, superior to all the things of this world.287
Venus’s approach to Adonis aligns itself with Sir Francis Bacon’s “audacious belief” that
natural magic allowed the scientist to encourage nature to “yield her secrets, which gave him
enhanced ‘powers’ that could be deployed . . . to ‘the effecting of all things possible.’”
288 Venus
promises Adonis a “thousand honey secrets” (17), and suggests, by the magniloquent epithets
she bestows upon him, that there are no limitations for Adonis. He might, as we shall see, even
become the sun god he once was. This “audacious belief” of Bacon’s was “underpinned by a
heightened confidence in human potential that was also supplied in swathes by the

Hermetica:”289
A human being is a great wonder, a living thing to be worshipped and honored: for
he changes his nature into a god’s, as if he were a god . . . He cultivates the earth; he
swiftly mixes into the elements; he plumbs the depths of the sea in the keenness of
his mind. Everything is permitted him.290
In Venus and Adonis it is a Goddess worshipping man, not man worshipping God. She is the one
honouring him. She emboldens him to change “his nature into a god’s, as if he were a god” (the
sun god). In Venus’s eyes, the only thing between man (Adonis) and the stars is himself. In
Adonis’s Puritanical eyes, however, this is all clearly heretical: man is not “a living thing to be
worshipped,” and he does not of his own doing change “his nature into a god’s.” It is also not at
all true that “everything is permitted him.” He is to patiently wait for God to transform him into a
‘son of God’ at the resurrection,291 and there are few things God does permit him to do.292
The grandiose promises of Venus may also be comparable with those of the Hermeticist
as they are put in Christian—but not Puritanical—terms in the following passage:
Let him [man] revere himself as an image of the divine God. Let him hope to ascend
again to God, as soon as the Divine Majesty deigns in some way to descend to him.
Let him love God with all his heart, so to transform himself into Him, who through
singular love wonderfully transformed Himself into Man.293
In Venus and Adonis, the Divine Majesty (in the form of Venus) has deigned “in some way to

descend” to man (in the form of Adonis), and it is as if Venus expects that, “as soon as” she does
so, Adonis shall “ascend again to God” (to his sun god status) through consummating the
matrimonial mystery with her.294 Again, this Christianized brand of Hermeticism, Christianized
though it be, is heretical to the Puritan. For him, it is vain to “revere” oneself, and to “transform”
oneself “into Him.”295 In response to this statement of Ficino’s, the Puritanical Adonis might say,
‘Yes, “through singular love,” God “wonderfully transformed Himself into Man,” but it is God
who will transform us into the sons of God, not the other way around.’296
As for the stanza’s final couplet (“Nature that made thee with herself at strife/Saith that
the world hath ending with thy life,” 11-12), Mortimer notes that, for the modern reader, it
“inevitably invites comparison with Shakespeare’s own Sonnet 20 on the ‘Master-Mistress,’”297
the last six lines of which merit especial attention:
And for a woman wert thou first created,
Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,
And by addition me of thee defeated
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
 But since she pricked thee out for women’s pleasure,
 Mine be thy love and thy love’s use their treasure. (9-14)
As Mortimer notes, in this context, the couplet of lines 11-12 of Venus and Adonis becomes
richly ironic:
In the sonnet an apparently transgressive situation, the desire of male for male, is

Jennings 78
restored to conformity with the natural order by the lover’s renunciation of sexual
satisfaction. In the narrative poem an apparently natural situation, the desire of
female for male, is shown as inwardly transgressive and the lover insists on physical
satisfaction. The “one thing” that defeats the speaker of the Sonnets would be very
much to the purpose of Venus and it turns out to be the one thing she cannot
control.298
Here it is the Puritanical Adonis who renounces Love’s satisfaction. It is difficult for him to
reconcile the argument that “nature is a straightforward procreative machine” with a nature that
evidently “uses effeminate beauty to excite female desire.”299 As Mortimer writes, “Venus may
not be fully aware of her own complex and contradictory urges, but what she will discover in her
descent to human love is truly a nature ‘with herself at strife,’ too complex, too incoherent and
too contradictory to offer any kind of norm.”300 Her desire (which is the spiritual alchemist’s
desire) for ideal syntheses between ostensibly mutually exclusive antitheses is precluded by the
Puritanical perception of Adonis who fails to see productive fusion therein. Venus is compelled
as a result to “change manner and argument without warning,”301 as if constantly gauging
Adonis’s responsiveness (or lack thereof) and adjusting her argument in accordance with his
silent rejections. Consistent with my extension of Hughes’s insight, Mortimer observes that
Venus’s “inexhaustible profusion” and the “inventivity of her rhetoric” emerges “in the long
run” as the “desperate adaptability of someone whose initial certainties have been undermined
and who is reduced to clutching at straws.”302 Her initial certainty was that “man” (Adonis) shall

Jennings 79
“ascend again to God” (to ‘sun god’ status) “as soon as the Divine Majesty” (Venus) “deigns in
some way to descend to him.”
303 Adonis’s Puritanical rejection of Gnosis undermines her “initial
certainties” and she is thereby “reduced” to the tragicomic role of desperate adaptability
incarnate.304
Moreover, the couplet “Nature that made thee with herself at strife/Saith that the world
hath ending with thy life” (11-12), beyond its purely Neoplatonic application, may capture yet
another Puritanical-Gnostic distinction. For the Puritan, the spiritual “life” of Adonis,305 in his
capacity as the Biblical Christ, renders the world dead. That is, from the Puritanical perspective,
the life that is in Christ conquers and destroys the world that could not destroy him.306 The true
Christian is to be at enmity with the world.307 But from the Gnostic perspective, nature produced
Puritanism which has anathematized her into an evil void, thereby rendering dead the mother that
gave it life. Venus, in her capacity as the Gnostic Sophia, is the one who, through her fall from
heaven, became nature, and Jaldabaoth is the son of hers who through his Puritanical
misperception reduces, imprisons, and spiritually slays her.308
The next stanza is most revealing of Venus’s allegiance to Gnosticism:
‘Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed
And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow;
If thou wilt deign this favour, for thy meed
A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know.

 Here come and sit where never serpent hisses;
 And, being sat, I’ll smother thee with kisses. (13-18)
J.W. Lever, who sees Venus as the Puritanical Adonis does, calls her “the personification of lust
that sullies all it touches; mistress of the dark horse from Plato’s Phaedrus; a figure of evil
eminence comparable with Milton’s Satan.”309 Franklin M. Dickey concurs.310 Don Cameron
Allen, who had drawn the Platonic parallel before Lever, concludes less viscerally that Venus’s
lesson, which she will draw at 259-408, is marred by Shakespeare’s phrase “breeding jennet”
(260).311 Streitberger, also siding with Adonis, argues that the “description of the horse in Plato .
. . is part of his description of the soul, composed of the passionate and docile horses and the
charioteer. Shakespeare’s sophisticated readers could hardly have missed seeing the reverse of
Venus’ allegory—the bit and rider as morality and reason abandoned for passion.”312 While such
critics as Miller also read the horse as representative of the lower passion governed by reason,313
the horse symbol, as Muir observes,314 may also be seen as inherently ambivalent, used as it is in
Antony and Cleopatra to celebrate erotic love (“O happy horse, to bear the weight of
Antony!”)315 Rather than simply siding with Adonis as these critics do, we might see the poet as
exploiting the symbol’s inherent ambivalence to reinforce the poem’s Puritanical-Gnostic
structure.

By having Venus ask Adonis to “alight” his “steed/And rein his proud head to the saddlebow” (13-14)—and by having her promise that, if he should do so, he shall be rewarded with a
“thousand honey secrets” (17)—the poet captures at once, in a single image, how Gnosis is
viewed from the Gnostic perspective and the Puritanical perspective. From the Gnostic
perspective, Gnosis (cultivation of occult power through esoteric knowledge) emancipates man
from his bestial nature and elevates him into divinity.316 On this view, Adonis’s horse represents
his bestial fetters (so long as he is on his horse, he is tied to his animal nature). From the
Puritanical perspective, however, Adonis on his horse represents the rational ego’s executive
control over his animal instincts, and more generally man’s dominion over the animal
kingdom.317 Venus asks Adonis to alight his steed, not so that he can walk freely on his own, but
so that she can take its place. By replacing the horse, she may be understood, from the
Puritanical perspective, as inserting her demoniacal self into his subconscious (which was
previously occupied by his bestial instincts as symbolized by his horse, but where she will now
be the one in control). By contrast, the Gnostic views the substitution of a Goddess—divinity—
for a horse—animality—as an improvement. Fittingly, the Puritan views the Gnostic’s selfdeification as proud ambition,318 and yet here Venus refers to the horse’s head as the “proud” one
(14).
Should Adonis “deign this favour,” for his “meed” (15)—his reward, though Mortimer
reads a pun for “mead,” suggestive of the “honey-pot” between Venus’s legs319—he is promised
“a thousand honey secrets” (16), which is, for the Puritan, the forbidden knowledge the infernal

serpent promised Eve.320 Yet this time, the exchange of forbidden knowledge for one’s ‘horse’
(what is the rational ego’s executive control over one’s animal instincts for the Puritan,321 but
base animality for the Gnostic,322 and what fittingly was dominion over the animal kingdom for
Adam and Eve)323 is promised to take place “where never serpent hisses” (17)—a phrase all too
reminiscent of the infernal serpent’s promise that Eve shall not die.324 Whereas the serpent
falsely promised immunity from death, here Venus promises an absence of serpents who make
false promises. Hamilton notes that, in the very act of promising a prelapsarian state purged of
the infernal serpent’s susurration, she is “hissing herself like a serpent” at him.325 Once Adonis
has been “sat” (18)—which Mortimer reads as an event that is to take place on Venus’s lap,326 in
which case the “serpent” (17), typical of Venus’s gender inversions, may, in her capacity as a
male devil garbed as a goddess,327 have an ironic phallic connotation—Venus promises to
“smother” him with kisses (18).
Mortimer adds that the “honey is, however, not merely erotic; it also suggests the
maternal tempting of a child with sweetmeats, and Shakespeare may intend us to hear the
mother-rhyme in ‘I’ll smother thee with kisses’ (18).”328 Mortimer’s reading here, apparently
unbeknownst to him, is utterly consistent with Hughes. The word “(s)mother” encapsulates
Venus’s heavenly maternal aspect and her earthly bridal aspect at once—she wishes to both

Jennings 83
smother him as a lover and mother him. Also apparently unbeknownst to Mortimer, his general
claim that there is no consistent Neoplatonic ascent in Venus and Adonis is not inconsistent with
Hughes’s reading. Kolin writes that “[g]enerally speaking . . . critics who explore Venus’ role as
mother have emphasized either the milch doe or vulture side of her nature.”329 In doing so, they
have neglected to account for the interrelation between her disparate natures. Hughes’s insight
allows us to see Venus as the heavenly “milch doe” Mother Goddess who is intent on being
Adonis’s earthly Sacred Bride but who ends up being collapsed by Adonis’s Puritanical
misperception into her infernal aspect and thus condemned to live out the “vulture side of her
nature.” Mortimer observes here, as Hughes does, that Venus’s “desire for Adonis has, from the
start, co-existed with maternal protective elements and her transformation into a mater dolorosa
remains erotic.”
330 Of the word “smother,” he goes on to write that the “verb, with its blend of
physical aggression and over-protectiveness, is typical of Venus and should lead one to
appreciate why Adonis later argues (523-28) that intercourse with her would be a threat to his
development rather than a step towards manhood,”331 where “step towards manhood” may be
understood as symbolic of the step towards godhood the Gnostic Sophia promises the Puritan,
and where “threat to his development” may be understood as the way in which the Puritan views
Sophia’s Gnosis as ultimately inhibitive to one’s spiritual development by offering a counterfeit
divinity that leads to devil possession and ultimately eternal torment.332
Venus, as if aware she has given away too much—as if aware of how the Puritanical
Adonis is taking what she has just offered—shifts to what turns out to be a vain attempt to

mitigate the damage:
‘And yet not cloy thy lips with loathed satiety,
But rather famish them amid their plenty,
Making them red, and pale, with fresh variety;
Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty.
 A summer’s day will seem an hour but short,
 Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.’ (19-24)
As Mortimer observes, Venus “seems to recognize the negative implications of her own imagery
and seeks to correct them. Just as earlier she had promised secret knowledge without loss of
innocence, so now she promises satisfaction without loss of desire.”333 All she ends up doing is
confirming the Puritan’s suspicions by offering the same incoherent, too-good-to-be-true Gnostic
formula with different variables plugged into it. Perhaps Adonis’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction
compels her to promise the paradox that is moderation-in-overindulgence, when she tries to
reassure him with an addendum (“And yet not cloy thy lips with loathed satiety,/But rather
famish them amid their plenty,” 19-20). The Puritan’s gripe with the things of this world is that
they do not satisfy: with pleasure comes sin, and with sin, death.334 She therefore promises him
not only “fresh variety” through malnourishment amid excess (21), but she even ‘shows’ him
how this can be when she promises “Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty” (22). As
Mortimer observes, this inducement, “like so many of Venus’ inducements, cuts both ways at
once, for she cannot promise endless pleasure without simultaneously presenting the sexual
appetite as one that cannot be assuaged.”335 Mortimer writes of line 22 that

333 Mortimer, 45.

335 Mortimer, 46.
Jennings 85
Instead of the predictable antimetabole ABBA which might suggest a vicious circle,
we are given ABBA+, conveying the sense of an upward spiral which, rather than
returning to the starting-point, rises to an ever-higher intensity where the confusion
of time (what’s long? what’s short?) eliminates the problem of alternating states. But
time, after all, will not be beguiled and the poem will continue to remind us of its
passing (177-80, 529-34, 727-32, 853-58).336
That is, rather than the predictable, ‘Ten kisses short as one, one long as ten,’ ten is transformed
into twenty, thus offering a glimpse into the occult means whereby she might provide the
extraordinary—and therefore suspect—“fresh variety” she has promised (21). But the word
“wasted” (24)—evoking as it does, for the modern reader, Sonnet 129’s “Th’expense of spirit in
a waste of shame”337—will not work so well on the ear of Adonis, nor will the phrase “timebeguiling sport” (24), reminding him as it will of the beguilement of Eve.338
 The Gnostic Sophia’s Extreme Passion
S. Clark Hulse reads the poem as conveying “three Venuses—comic, sensual, and
violent—all embodying earthly love but differently depicted to reveal different aspects.”339 John

moment and frightening the next.”340 Like Doebler, Hughes perceives Venus’s ever-shifting
nature, and like Hulse, he reads Venus as having three aspects, only he categorizes them as
follows: the Divine Mother (her heavenly aspect), the Sacred Bride (her earthly aspect), and the
Queen of Hell (her infernal aspect, to which Adonis’s Puritanical misperception collapses her).341
Ellen April Harwood corroborates Hughes’s triune Venus when she writes that “Neo-platonists”
(one of the things the syncretic Gnostics of the early modern period were) “distinguished Venus
Urania, who symbolized the beauty of the divine mind, from Venus Pandemos, beauty realized
in the sublunary world,” and adds that Spenser’s Garden of Adonis, which she views as a
prominent source for Shakespeare’s Venus and Adonis,
342 specifically “excludes the third Venus
of the Neo-platonists, the bestial Venus identified with lust.”343 João Froes further confirms
Hughes’s view to be consistent with the ancient tradition of a Venus possessing these disparate
aspects.344 In line with the view that Shakespeare’s Venus is a syncretic fusion of Venus and
Sophia (among many other things), Irenaeus also describes Sophia as having this ever-shifting
nature when he writes of the Gnostics:
For at one time, as they affirm, she would weep and lament on account of being
left alone in the midst of darkness and vacuity; while, at another time, reflecting
on the light which had forsaken her, she would be filled with joy, and laugh; then,

again, she would be struck with terror; or, at other times, would sink into
consternation and bewilderment.345
While Hughes is less clear about Adonis, he may also be read as having three aspects: the Sun
God (his heavenly aspect), the Sacred Bridegroom (his earthly aspect), and the Puritanical
Goddess-repressor who is reincarnated as the Goddess-raping Tarquin in Lucrece (his infernal
aspect).346 According to the Gnostic, for whom reality is mental rather than physical (and hence
for whom perception dictates reality),347 Adonis’s Puritanical presuppositions cause him to
‘misperceive’ the Goddess who is inherently a potentiality rather than a fully-formed actuality.348
He is only able to see her infernal aspect,349 which is why her heavenly and earthly aspects are
never able to come into complete focus in the poem and are ever inextricable from each other as
well as from the infernal one by which they are condemned to be ever sullied.350 Initiation into
her mystery is unpredictable: as the neophyte sees her, so will the Goddess manifest.351 This
Gnostic doctrine might be summarized thus: The world in the soul makes the world the soul is in.
Healy corroborates Hughes’s understanding of the Gnostic Goddess in her study of
Renaissance spiritual alchemy. For the early modern Alchemist who encounters the Goddess, she
is a potentiality whose ontology is beholden to the whims of her percipient:
Always dark and female, she is both the ‘power of desire and longing in man’
and a potent force that ‘develops all the capacities hidden in the soul, against or in
keeping with the desires of the ego, depending on whether the latter assimilates

the power of nature, or becomes its victim.’ As Sophia or ‘wisdom’ she is a
positive, nurturing power but as extreme passion she binds the soul and blocks
spiritual progression.352
The Goddess’s “ambivalent, shifting nature – actually a reflection of her lover’s conflicting
desires – and her spiritually improving potential help us to understand” not only the “seemingly
ironic Shakespearean lines” that are Healy’s concern, but the Venus of the poem that is ours.353
This description of the Gnostic Goddess is precisely the sort of description one would expect on
the antithetical framework Hughes’s insight invites. If Venus functions, at the allegorical level,
as the Gnostic Sophia, the poet should represent her as having this “ambivalent, shifting nature”
to serve as a reflection of Adonis’s shifting desire (or as a desperate response to his persistent
lack thereof). Moreover, her “spiritually improving potential” is latent in the poem’s structure.
The combination of Adonis’s i) mythological heritage, the ii) pun which his name affords, and
his iii) relation to Titan render him a potential sun god (175-198). Venus as Sophia promises
esoteric knowledge (“A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know,” 16) whereby Adonis might
realize his divine potential. She might develop “all the capacities hidden in the soul,” only, in
Adonis’s case, this development is “against” rather than “in keeping with” the “desires” of his
“ego.” Adonis, the rational Puritanical ego, does not assimilate the “power of nature” but rather
“becomes its victim.” From the Gnostic perspective, she is the Goddess Sophia and therefore the
bearer of esoteric wisdom: she is a “positive, nurturing power.” But for the Puritanical Adonis,
she manifests as an overwhelmingly “extreme passion.” She “binds” his “soul” and “blocks
spiritual progression,” as signified by her suffocating physical aggression.

Mortimer writes that through her “profuse and ingenious rhetoric” Venus “excites herself
more than she excites Adonis and the result is a potentially endless rhythm of frustration where
eloquence repeatedly topples over into physical aggression and where the defeat of that
aggression provokes a new bout of eloquence.”354 The reader is introduced to Venus’s physical
aggression in the very next stanza:
With this, she seizeth on his sweating palm,
The precedent of pith and livelihood,
And, trembling in her passion, calls it balm—
Earth’s sovereign salve to do a goddess good.
 Being so enraged, desire doth lend her force
 Courageously to pluck him from his horse. (25-30)
Mortimer’s reading of lines 25-28 is particularly pertinent:
Gypsies try to read palms in a sense favorable to their clients: since Venus here is
both gypsy and client, she has no difficulty in making the hand provide the answer
she wants. Her misreading predictably leads to more hyperbole which culminates in
more physical action. As if ashamed of her own earthiness, she renames the sweat
with imagery that combines the politico-religious (the anointing of a monarch) with
the medical. By a startling inversion of the cosmic hierarchy it is the earthly subject
who produces a salve to heal the queen and goddess.355
This “startling inversion” is a prime example of the Gnostic’s “turning of things upside
down.”356 Rather than the Puritan’s sweat being what, for him, it is (sweat in need of relief from

Jennings 90
the divine), she metamorphoses it into something capable of—even necessary for—healing
divinities. She inverts the cosmic hierarchy so that it is Puritanism that has rendered the gods ill,
rather than sin that has rendered man ill and in need of divine redemption.357
The key factor in this stanza is rage. The rage of line 29’s “enraged” is echoed in the
rage of line 30’s “Courageously,” upon which the stress also fittingly falls (“Being so enraged,
desire doth lend her force/Courageously to pluck him from his horse”). Rufus Putney, who wants
to reduce the poem to its comic dimension, summarizes his view when he writes that
“Shakespeare’s jocose tone fumigates the eroticism and belies the critical conviction that he had
any serious intention beyond writing a delightful poem.”358 Putney sees lines 29 and 30 simply as
a set-up for the “absurd picture that follows of Venus with the flushed, indignant Adonis tucked
under one arm, his horse’s reins over the other, hastening to the bank that is their destined battleground.”359 The comic dimension is surely there; however, if we avail ourselves of Hughes’s
insight and allow ourselves to see the poem in terms of a specifically Puritanical-Gnostic
conflict, an additional layer of the poem is opened up to us. Here the Goddess of Love is
somehow aided by Desire (29), where the one god is imagined as being in need of divine help
from the other, and where it is Love’s rage that seems to summon just the divinity she needs for
the occasion (29-30). It is as if Adonis’s Puritanical perception has caused the Goddess of Love
to split into three separate manifestations, rendering her a triune goddess of Lust comprising
three parts (Love, Rage, and Desire), wherein Desire is perhaps the Mother, Rage the ‘Unholy
Spirit,’ and she (the image of invisible Lust)360 the daughter. The phrase “pluck him from his

horse” also anticipates the flower-plucking imagery of lines 127-132, evoking Venus’s desire to
pluck the flower of Adonis’s virginity at the same time as it foreshadows Venus’s plucking of the
flower into which Adonis will be metamorphosed at death (1175).
Consistent with my thesis is Mortimer’s observation that the “dilemma of Venus who
cannot resist using on Adonis the strength that she wishes he would use on her is neatly
embodied” in the “hilarious cartoon-like vignette” which lines 31 and 32 comprise (“Over one
arm, the lusty courser’s rein;/Under her other was the tender boy”).361 Mortimer writes that with
“one arm she holds the lustiness of the horse and with the other the tenderness of Adonis. What
Venus wants but cannot have is the lustiness and the tenderness united in the same object. She
appears momentarily as a gigantic walking antithesis.”362 Putney views lines 31 and 32 as doing
nothing more than acquainting the reader “with Shakespeare’s mirth,”363 but an additional layer
of the poem is opened up to us if we read this “hilarious cartoon-like vignette” as the
embodiment of the spiritual alchemist’s desire to synthesize all ostensibly mutually exclusive
antitheses (and how this syncretic project appears to the Puritan). Just as Venus promised an
ideal combination of forbidden knowledge and prelapsarian innocence (recall how I unpacked
the line “More white and red than doves or roses are,” 10), then promised satisfaction without
loss of desire, and just as she “cannot argue that Adonis should take the male initiative without
effectively appropriating the male role for herself,” and just as her “advocacy of procreation (in
keeping with her mythical status as Venus Genitrix) fails to mask the underlying truth that one
aspect of her passion is not to have a child by Adonis but to have Adonis as her child,”364 so now

she wants the “lustiness” of the horse united with the “tenderness” of Adonis and the best she
can do is hold both simultaneously.
That immediately after Venus ties Adonis’s horse she assays to tie the “rider” (40) is
confirmation for the Puritan that the evil one behind Gnosticism does not have man’s best
interests in mind (or else this behavior of hers is explained by the Puritanical perception that
compels it to so manifest). At stanza 9, the poet appears to adopt Venus’s perspective in
inverting Adonis’s gender by applying the phrase “maiden burning” to his red cheeks (50). But it
is the shift between stanzas 10 and 11 that most aptly captures Hughes’s grasp of the changing
perspectives which Mortimer also perceives. We first read:
Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,
Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh, and bone,
Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste
Till either gorge be stuffed or prey be gone,
 Even so she kissed his brow, his cheek, his chin,
 And where she ends she doth anew begin. (55-60)
On Hughes’s reading, this is the Great Whore of Babylon that is the Roman Catholic Church as
viewed from the Protestant censor Whitgift’s perspective,365 and the perennial Goddess as
reduced to her infernal aspect via Adonis’s Puritanical ‘misperception.’ As Mortimer notes, this
“undeniably unpleasant” imagery “recalls Ovid’s Olympian rapists in their most bestial forms,”
but the simile “tells us not so much what the desire of Venus is really like as what it looks like to
the observer and, no doubt, feels like to Adonis.”366 For immediately, in the next stanza, we read

Jennings 93
what this same event feels like from Venus’s perspective:
Forced to content, but never to obey,
Panting he lies and breatheth in her face.
She feedeth on the steam as on a prey
And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace,
 Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers,
 So they were dewed with such distilling showers. (61-66)
As Mortimer notes, the “contrast with the previous stanza could hardly be greater and yet we
recognize that we are being offered different perspectives on the same reality.”367
Heather Dubrow observes here that Venus, in her capacity as “postlapsarian Eve,” assumes
“Adam’s function” when she “names—or, more to the point, renames—the objects around
her.”368 Dubrow goes on to write that “Adonis too is very concerned with naming and
misnaming,”369 citing as evidence the lines “Call it not love, for love to heaven is fled,/Since
sweating lust on earth usurped his name” (793-794). In Venus’s case, this subversive ‘renaming’
of things “typically assumes one form in particular: she tries to transform the material into the
spiritual,”370 precisely what the Gnostic does from the Puritanical perspective. That is, she
renders spiritual the vain things of this world, magically reconstituting them by renaming them
against (rather than in keeping with) the way in which the Puritanical God originally ‘named’
them. Here the Gnostic law of reversal is employed as follows. She (a celestial divinity) renders
herself earthly (“gardens full of flowers,” 65) and the earthly Adonis’s breath heavenly (by

367 Mortimer, 52.

370 Dubrow, 226.
Jennings 94
renaming it “heavenly moisture,” 64). For the Puritan, it is God alone who bestows upon
humanity the grace it so desperately needs.371 Here, the divine Venus renames the earthly
Adonis’s breath “air of grace” (64), thus granting him the power to bestow his grace upon her. In
sum, she inverts the cosmic hierarchy by rendering herself the earthly “gardens full of flowers”
(a self-transformation which recalls the Gnostic Sophia’s metamorphosis from the Pleromatic
light of the heavenly heights into the earth for our sake),372 and by rendering the earthly Adonis
the heavens above which are to rain “distilling showers” upon her (65-66), in which case it will
be the earthly mortal sustaining the celestial divinity.
This inversion is accomplished through the power of alchemical imagination, but where it
is, paradoxically, the imaginary result that is most alchemical: she, a celestial Goddess, shall be
“dewed” with the “distilling showers” of a mere mortal. ‘Distillation’ (alongside “dissolving,
“cleansing,” and “smelting”) is one of the key processes of Renaissance alchemy which leads
ultimately to the sort of “transmutation” which Venus here imagines, whereby heaven and earth
switch places and are reunited through cosmic inversion.373 Fittingly, as Healy notes, these
processes which could be “observed taking place in the refining apparatuses of chemistry could
be projected on to mental processes and vice versa.”374 It is only fitting, then, that such
laboratorial processes as cleansing and dissolving (cleansing Adonis’s earthly breath by
dissolving it into “heavenly moisture,” and then purifying it into “air of grace,” 64) should
involve the projection of laboratorial processes onto Venus’s divine imagination and lead back
into the laboratorial result of her being “dewed” with “distilling showers” (66).

The lines “Look how a bird lies tangled in a net,/So fastened in her arms Adonis lies” (67-
68) brings the question of liberty and autonomy to the fore (‘Which system,’ we are led to ask,
‘is more freeing, Puritanism or Gnosticism?’). Here Mortimer cautions:
The real issue is not that Venus threatens to destroy Adonis, but that she tries to
deprive him of his freedom. And lest anyone should argue that this amounts to the
same thing, it should be remembered that it is Adonis’ regained liberty rather than his
temporary captivity that brings about his death.375
This may be read as yet another Gnostic inversion of Biblical doctrine. Just as Jehovah’s
restriction of knowledge in the Garden of Eden is viewed by the Gnostic as wicked (at the same
time as it was Eve’s supposed self-enfranchisement from Jehovah’s fetters that brought about her
death, which in her case was spiritual rather than physical),376 here Venus’s restrictiveness is
rendered apparently wicked but is in reality what supposedly keeps Adonis out of harm’s way.
Mortimer reads lines 67 and 68 as the author’s invitation of a “more balanced view” after
“juxtaposing the event as it appears and the event as it is subjectively reconstructed.”377
According to Mortimer, here “Adonis is still a prey of sorts, but the birdcatching simile would
suggest that he is in more danger of being tamed and kept for amusement than of being eaten
alive (anticipating ‘Like a wild bird being tamed with too much handling,’ 560).”378 The image
nicely embodies the Puritanical-Gnostic debate, as the “bird” (man insofar as he is a spirit) is
here “tangled in a net” (a bad thing from the Puritanical perspective),379 and yet he is perhaps
entangled only so that he may be tamed (by the wisdom of the Goddess) and taught (through

Gnosis) how to fly better. It is all too fitting that Venus should be the bird in the previous image,
and that Adonis should be the bird in this one: this pattern notifies the astute reader that a shift in
perspective (and an attempt to reconcile the shift) has taken place. The former shows the reader
in what sense Adonis sees Venus as a bird, the latter in what sense Venus (and the poet through
her eyes) sees Adonis as one.
The poet then renders Venus a demoniacal rapist who derives sadistic pleasure from
Adonis’s “Pure shame and awed resistance” (69) to capture how the Goddess of Gnosis is
viewed through Puritanical eyes. It is specifically his “resistance” which is said to have “bred
more beauty in his angry eyes” (69-70), where it is, not Venus and Adonis themselves, but the
sadism of Venus and the resistance of Adonis doing the breeding.380 Mortimer observes that the
couplet of lines 71-72 can be seen, not only in the “immediate context,” in which it “points to
Venus (the ‘rank’ current of her lust),” but also as a “generalization that is relevant to both
protagonists” (“Rain added to a river that is rank/Perforce will force it overflow the bank,” 71-
72).381 The couplet not only captures the “first of Venus’ many orgasms”382—and therefore the
Gnostic’s wicked carnality from the Puritanical perspective383—but also the unhealthy repression
of desire which the Gnostic views as the Puritan’s illness.384 The r of “Rain” literally seems to be
“added” to the r of the “river that is rank.” The consonance of the f sound, coupled with the
assonance of the o sound, then captures how the rain “Perforce will force it overflow the bank,”
otherwise emphasized as “Perforce will force it overflow the bank.” At the couplet’s
culmination, the lack of the f consonance and o assonance in the “bank” signifies the abrupt,

unexpected change of the consummated overflow.
In the stanza that follows, Venus’s “energy is momentarily exhausted and she returns to
verbal persuasion.”385 Mortimer observes that the narrator’s rhetoric, “with its anaphora,
epistrophe, polyptoton and, of course its red-white antithesis, enacts the prettiness of which it
speaks”:386
Still she ENTREATS and prettily ENTREATS,
For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale.
Still is he sullen, still he lours and frets
’Twixt CRIMSON shame and anger ASHY-PALE.
 Being RED, she loves him BEST; and being WHITE,
 Her BEST is BETTERED with a more delight. (My emphases, 73-78)
Here the poet is showing off his rhythm, his Pythagorean music—his power to enact whatever he
speaks of. What Mortimer goes on to observe is surprisingly consistent with Hughes’s reading of
the Goddess’s three aspects:
In a poem that revels in the observation of small things (the caterpillar, the
divedapper, the snail), the “pretty ear” of Adonis need not be taken as a
straightforward synecdoche. The detail suggests the delicate, finely-chiseled beauty
of Adonis, and Venus’ admiration for her beloved’s ear—not normally an object of
intense erotic attraction—has a tender, intimate quality like maternal absorption in
the anatomical minutiae of a newborn son.387
Even here, in what might appear to be a purely aesthetic stanza, Venus’s maternal and bridal

385 Mortimer, 54.

387 Mortimer, 54.
Jennings 98
aspects are inextricable from one another. Even here, Adonis, in his capacity as the “Aeon Jesus”
who has devolved into the Biblical literalist’s Jehovah, is at once the Sacred Bridegroom of
Sophia and her narcissistic child Jaldabaoth.
As for the stanza’s red-white antithesis, Hereward T. Price writes that throughout the
poem the “two colors are not only at war with one another; each is at war with itself.”388 This
‘warring with itself’ serves to enact the alchemical process, whereby things must become their
opposites in order that they may be reconciled with that to which, prior to becoming their
opposites, they were opposed; the Self must become the Other, and therefore its opposite, before
it can see itself as it truly is—identical with all things.389 Moreover, the red-white antithesis of
this stanza further reinforces the poem’s Gnostic-Puritanical structure. For the Gnostic Venus,
white and red are not inevitably at odds. For her, that a thing is “best” does not mean it cannot be
“bettered” (78). It is through Venus’s (rather than Adonis’s) perspective that we see: “Being red
she loves him best, and being white,/Her best is bettered with a more delight” (77-78). For
Venus, even in a war in which one colour must defeat the other, neither ends up on top: the two
are mysteriously reconciled in that the one being bettered remains “best” (78). Conversely,
through Adonis’s perspective, we see that red and white can be reconciled only in death:
O what a sight it was wistly to view,
How she came stealing to the wayward boy,
To note the fighting conflict of her hue,
How white and red each other did destroy:
 But now her cheek was pale, and by and by

388 Price, 118.
389 Healy, 12.
Jennings 99
 It flashed forth fire, as lightning from the sky. (343-348)
Here, the “fighting conflict of her hue” (345) does not lead to the quasi-reconciliation of one
being “best” and the other bettering it (78). Here white and red simply “destroy” each other
(346). The Gnostic Venus is ever intent on reconciliation through transgressive syntheses; the
Puritanical Adonis’s vision is restricted to antithetical distinctions. With ‘savage irony,’390 white
and red will finally be mingled together in the mouth of the boar, wherein Adonis’s whiteness
and redness shall “Like milk and blood” be “mingled both together” (902). Here the m of mouth
and the b sound of bepainted are even linguistically “mingled both together” in the lines “Whose
frothy mouth bepainted all with red/Like milk and blood being mingled both together” (my
emphases, 901-902). For failing to see how red and white (serpentine wisdom and dove-like
innocence) reconcile themselves through the Gnostic’s syncretic project, the Puritanical Adonis
ends up having his white milk and his red blood “mingled both together” in the mouth of the
boar to which his Puritanical misperception reduces the Goddess of Gnosis. To add to Price’s
memorable words (“Then the boar . . . Venus in her most horrible symbol”’),391 we might say the
boar is Venus and Adonis collapsed into their most horrible union.392
Regarding poetic enactment, even more impressive will be lines 427-432, where Venus
responds with incredulity at the discovery that Adonis possesses the power of speech:
‘What, canst thou talk?’ quoth she. ‘Hast thou a tongue?
O, would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing.
Thy mermaid’s voice hath done me double wrong.
I had my load before, now pressed with bearing:

390 See Price, 116.

392 Price, 116.
Jennings 100
 Melodious discord, heavenly tune harsh-sounding,
 Ears’ deep sweet music, and heart’s deep-sore wounding.’ (427-432)
First, she will complain, “Thy mermaid’s voice hath done me double wrong” (my emphases,
429), enacting not only the twofold wrong his verbal rejection has done her, but also the
duplicity involved in his pretense at speechlessness, as well as the reverberating effect of this
newfound echo (her shock that the poem in which she finds herself should turn out to have two
speakers). Next, she describes Adonis’s voice thus: “Melodious discord, heavenly tune harsh
sounding,/Ears’ deep-sweet music, and heart’s deep-sore wounding” (431-432). Here the
assonance of the hard o sound in “Melodious discord” falls on the stress in the case of the first
word but not in the case of the second (431), and likewise with the h consonance of “heavenly
tune harsh sounding” (431). Here we find i) “[m]elodious” attention being paid to word choice at
the level of literary minutiae and a simultaneous ii) “discord” between the stresses on which the
carefully selected letters fall (my emphases). The following line (“Ears’ deep-sweet music, and
heart’s deep-sore wounding,” 432) will only reinforce the effect by enacting the no-longermerely-double but now doubly-thrice-deep wound Adonis’s voice inflicts upon Venus’s heart
through the repetition of three hard consecutive stresses: “Ears’ deep-sweet music, and heart’s
deep-sore wounding” (my emphases, 432).
Venus, insofar as she is the planet named after her, is the Pythagorean musical sphere
whose harmony none but the illumined may hear.393 She is trying to get Adonis to hear her
heavenly harmony, that she may harmonize the not-so-heavenly discord within him. For among
Neo-Pythagoreans (what the early modern syncretic Gnostics also were) it was believed that the
right kind of music could cure illness, which was itself caused by disharmony between the

393 Healy, 77-97.
Jennings 101
‘strings’ of the musical instrument that is the body.394 It only makes sense, then, that Venus, in
her capacity as a planet, should be as attentive to sound as she proves to be throughout the poem,
and that here (at 431-432) she should recognize the potential for sweet harmony within Adonis
but at the same time gawk at the horrendous spiritual discord of the Puritanical state he is in.
The Gnostic’s Masculine-Feminine Synthesis Viewed as an Emasculating Threat
Venus’s expurgated retelling of her liaison with Mars serves as evidence for the Gnostic
Venus’s recognition of Puritanism in her beloved. The episode also serves to forge a distinction
between the way in which the Gnostic Goddess shapes events to produce particular effects in her
reticent interlocutor and the way in which the Puritanical Adonis perceives her devices. The
episode particularly serves to capture the distinction between i) Venus’s Gnostic project of
synthesizing the masculine with the feminine and ii) Adonis’s perception of this project as a
diabolically emasculating one.
As it merits especial attention, it is worth laying out the Mars episode in full. Venus
recounts:
‘I have been wooed as I entreat thee now
Even by the stern and direful god of war,
Whose sinewy neck in battle ne’er did bow,
Who conquers where he comes in every jar.
 Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,
 And begged for that which thou unasked shalt have.

394 Healy, 77-97.
Jennings 102
‘Over my altars hath he hung his lance,
His battered shield, his uncontrollèd crest,
And for my sake hath learned to sport and dance,
To toy, to wanton, dally, smile, and jest,
 Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red,
 Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.
‘Thus he that over-ruled I overswayed,
Leading him prisoner in a red-rose chain.
Strong-tempered steel his stronger strength obeyed,
Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.
 O, be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,
 For mast’ring her that foiled the god of fight. (97-114)
As Mortimer notes, when Venus “seeks to enhance her own attractions by giving a wisely
expurgated version of the Homeric tale of her affair with Mars (97-114),” she notably omits the
“net which the jealous Vulcan throws over the lovers and their embarrassing exposure to the
voyeuristic gaze of the assembled gods.”395 Heather Dubrow describes Venus’s “omission of the
humiliating conclusion of her liaison with Mars” as an event in which “they were both mastered,
both caught in a net.”396 Hulse writes that if “Mars here is robbed of heroism, one may recall that
to the Neoplatonists the love of Mars and Venus was an allegory of a transcendent concordance
of Virtue and Pleasure.”397 Mortimer, as if in response to Hulse, claims that “neither the homilies

396 Dubrow, 228.
397 Hulse, 213.
Jennings 103
of Ovide moralisé nor the visionary solemnities of the Neoplatonists will provide a convincing
explanation of how this episode works in Venus and Adonis,”398 to which it may be replied that
the Gnostic Venus is here clearly expurgating the part of the story that captures the consequence
of transgressive love affairs—precisely what is on the Puritanical Adonis’s mind. She promises
forbidden knowledge without loss of innocence, satisfaction without loss of desire, and
transgressive love affairs that are never discovered and for which there are no consequences (at
least this is how Gnosticism, though it may claim itself to be rigorously ascetic in purifying itself
for contact with the divine, appears to the Puritan).399
Mortimer then notes that a “potential lover is rarely encouraged by praise of his
predecessor and if Mars embodies the kind of virility needed to satisfy Venus, then Adonis might
well shrink from the task.”400 He goes on to say more than he realizes when he writes that
“Venus is catholic in her tastes and she may, after all, be making a useful psychological
move.”401 The catholicity (universality) in her tastes is the metaphor for the spiritual catholicity
that aligns her more with the Catholic church than with Protestantism, and even more so with the
syncretic universalism of the Gnostic for which her Roman Catholicity is itself a veil behind her
Venal one. She converted the hypermasculine Mars and now wishes to convert the effeminate
Adonis; yet it is not so obvious just how much of Adonis’s effeminacy is latent within him and
how much of it is the projection (or even imagination) of Venus and the poet. In both cases she
appears to emasculate men associated with traditionally masculine pursuits (war and hunting),
and her boast to having emasculated Mars will not go over well with Adonis. The Gnostic views

401 Mortimer, 58.
Jennings 104
masculinity and femininity as latent within all persons, and he who ascends to Gnostic Nobility
as one who has synthesized his masculine with his feminine aspects.402 Venus’s attempt to
reconcile the masculine with the feminine manifests itself in the Puritan’s eyes as the
emasculation of the masculine by the hypermasculinized feminine.
Notably, the couplet which concludes the Mars-Venus episode (“O, be not proud, nor brag
not of thy might,/For mast’ring her that foiled the god of fight,” 113-14) presents this
“superficially sound” argument: “if I have conquered Mars and you conquer me, then you must
be a greater conqueror than Mars.”403 Though Mortimer claims the issue with this argument is
that its “emphasis falls on the emasculating power of female sexuality and is likely to serve
Adonis more as a warning than as an inducement,”404 surely its biggest problem is that it
reinforces rather than undermines Adonis’s Puritanical view. The Puritanical Adonis prides
himself on his ability to withstand temptation. Mars’s inability to withstand Venus’s temptation
only renders Adonis’s ability to do so a nobler feat than it had already seemed to be. Perhaps
Putney says more than he realizes when he writes, “Adonis’ disinterest inspires the recital of her
conquest of Mars, but her narration of that triumph brings fears lest Adonis pride himself on
excelling the god and consequently scorn her.”405 As if to anticipate this shortcoming in her
argument, Venus ensures that, should Adonis so misunderstand it, he will still end up rendering
himself “proud” for being able to withstand her whom the “god of fight” could not (where being
proud is the Puritan’s worst nightmare). The Puritan wants to be proud of himself in one sense—
proud of his steadfastness in obeying his master Christ, which includes steadfastness in

402 Healy, 68-72.

Jennings 105
humility406—but not “proud” in the Luciferian sense;407 he wants to make Christ proud of him
but not take any of the credit for it. It is through the power of the Holy Spirit alone that his good
works are performed.408 But even being proud of himself in this worse sense is probably a better
deal than ending up as Mars has ended up: Venus “had done well to avoid any reference to
Vulcan’s net, but her own ‘red-rose chain’ might seem to Adonis only a prettified version of a
hardly less disgraceful humiliation.”409 In the male war god’s battle with female Love, it is
clearly the “woman who emerges as the victor” and the military dignitary who is “reduced” to
the “Malvolio role of fatuous lover” after an “extraordinary list of synonyms (sport, toy, wanton,
dally, jest).”410 Mortimer observes that “the ‘lance’ and ‘uncontrollèd crest’ lose their phallic
power by being, as it were, detached from their owner and displayed as trophies on the altar of
Venus,”411 where the “lance” of Mars is a mirror for the “spear” of Adonis, which he would like
to hold onto and use, not in romantic pursuits, but to hunt the infernal aspect (what is for him the
true identity) of the one who desires to separate him from it and keep it on display as evidence of
her mastery over him.
Gnosticism’s Horatian Argument
Adonis’s complaint that Venus’s inducements to love are premature may be understood
as embodying the Puritan’s “fervent desire” for the ‘rapture’—the “manifestation of the sons of

God”412—for which he patiently waits.413 Whereas for Venus, spiritual metamorphosis is to be
had through immediate carnal knowledge (or immediate knowledge that manifests, in Adonis’s
Puritanical perception, as carnal),414 for Adonis, physical metamorphosis into a celestial body is
to be had through perseverance in chastity.
415 On this reading, Venus’s Horatian inducements to
“Make use of time; let not advantage slip” (129) are to be understood as the Gnostic’s refusal to
await the wisdom which the Puritan’s God promises to bestow upon man at the resurrection.416
That is, Venus insists that Adonis pursue illumination in the here and now, to resurrect himself
into the sun god while it is still within his power to be the master of his own fate. Adonis’s fear
of the sun god (his higher celestial self, who wishes to switch places with him, 175-198) causes
Venus to pretend the sun god (into which she wishes him to metamorphose himself in the here
and now) is harmless as compared with the devastating effect which the “earthly sun” that is
Adonis has upon her (193-198), in what appears to be mere hyperbolic praise of his beauty.
Adonis, who is, according to the Gnostic, presently held captive by the Jehovan demiurge in the
realm of shadows, and who is fearful of the sun—what is for the Neoplatonist the Form of
forms417—must be conciliated with shadows, precisely what Venus employs in her attempt to
soothe him (191).
Immediately after the Mars episode, we notice a drastic shift in Venus’s rhetoric:
‘Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine—
Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red—

Jennings 107
The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine.
What seest thou in the ground? Hold up thy head.
 Look in mine eyeballs: there thy beauty lies.
 Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?’ (115-120)
Mortimer observes that here, “as if some second sense made her aware of Adonis’ unspoken
objections to her rhetoric of conquest (‘over-ruled,’ ‘overswayed,’ ‘mast’ring,’ ‘servile,’
‘prisoner,’ 109-114), she rapidly changes direction and insists on love as mutual exchange
between equal partners” (115-120).418 Her usual rhetoric of competition and domination,
anatomized for us by Dubrow,419 is suddenly replaced by the give-and-take rhetoric of common
property. She suspects Adonis’s narcissism to be her obstacle, as is made even more explicit in
the following stanzas.420 Her appeal is now supposedly increased by the fact that his beauty is
reflected in her eyes. Her argument is that, if his beautiful eyes are in her eyes, his lips might as
well be on her lips (“Look in mine eyeballs: there thy beauty lies./Then why not lips on lips,
since eyes in eyes?” 119-120). This may serve as a play on the concept that ‘Beauty is in the eye
of the beholder.’ On one hand, Adonis apparently proves the maxim true by eschewing the very
Goddess of Love. On the other hand, being as he is Beauty himself, he is quite literally in the eye
of Beauty’s beholder. It therefore follows, by a certain sort of logic, that he cannot help but find
his beholder beautiful. Evidently, however, the logic does not hold in his case, for it turns out he
can.
Venus’s central argument, as conveyed in lines 127-132, is the Horatian carpe diem:
‘The tender spring upon thy tempting lip

Jennings 108
Shows thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted.
Make use of time; let not advantage slip.
Beauty within itself should not be wasted.
 Fair flowers that are not gathered in their prime
 Rot, and consume themselves in little time. (127-132)
As Mortimer observes, “even here Venus fails to reassure”: the “taste metaphor occurs before we
have forgotten the devouring fury of Venus as ‘the empty eagle’ (55-60)”—to the extent that the
word “tempting” might even recall the word “empty”—and the “association of temptation and
fruit has an inappropriate biblical resonance” (“The tender spring upon thy tempting lip/Shows
thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted,” 127-128), evoking as it does the “tempting”
forbidden fruit in an “argument that consumption preserves beauty from corruption.”421 Gnostics
infamously praise the serpent for granting Adam and Eve the forbidden knowledge which the
wicked Jehovan demiurge denied them.422 It is therefore fitting that she should evoke the same
argument here, and all too fitting that she should structure her conceit so that Adonis is the fruit
which is being forbidden, where he himself—the Gnostic inversion of the Puritanical god-man
(the Biblical literalist’s Adonai manifest in the flesh)—is the one doing the forbidding.
Venus’s assurance that “Love is a spirit all compact of fire,/Not gross to sink, but light,
and will aspire” (149-150) is evocative of Hermetic science, sounding as it does particularly
alchemical (laboratorial, even). Putney reads this, as he reads the entire poem, purely as a joke,
without telling us how the joke works.423 Presumably the joke is something like this: Love does
not go flaccid as in the love-eschewing Adonis’s case but rather erectly aspires. Putney quips that

421 Mortimer, 61.

423 Putney, 128.
Jennings 109
it could never “have been easy to write or read solemnly a poem in which falling is so common
an activity.”424 To this it may be replied that the poem’s antithetical structure, when conceived in
Puritanical-Gnostic terms, may allow the reader to see “falling” as having a profound theological
significance. Here Venus may be read as attempting to assuage Adonis’s fears that lustdisguised-as-love causes a fall (something she needs to do given that she, Love, appears to have
fallen from heaven; just as Lucifer himself is said to have done;425 and just as the Gnostic Sophia
is said to have fallen from the Pleromatic center of the heavenly heights to become the earth for
our sake).426 Hulse observes that
Shakespeare’s description of [Venus] is a metaphoric catalog of the characteristics
of physical love. When he wishes to show that love is light, that is, merry and
delightful, he says that Venus does not weigh much . . . We are used to the
physical being the literal, but literally Venus is delightful, and so she is figured as
if she were light in weight.427
Here Hulse captures an aesthetic layer of the poem to which the poet is constantly drawing the
astute reader’s attention. It is not that Venus is the Neoplatonist’s abstract form of Love and the
Neoplatonist’s abstract form of Love alone. Rather, it is that she is in some sense supposed to be.
The poet is exploiting the discrepancy between i) her anthropomorphic manifestation and ii) that
which she is supposedly an anthropomorphic manifestation of for the virtuosities of paradox and
paronomasia to which their interplay gives rise. Hulse, like Mortimer, perceives the incoherence
between Venus’s physical manifestation and the way she figures herself through rhetoric:

Jennings 110
“curiously, this reversal changes the impact of the image; instead of seeing a sylph supported on
flowers, we see tree trunks, holding aloft an awesome bulk.”428 Hulse concludes on a more or
less aesthetic note that Shakespeare is simply portraying love in the complex manner in which it
really manifests itself in the lives of humans: at once as “loathsome, foul lust,” “delightful
sense,” and a “near-sacred force of natural propagation.”429 That is, we are not to answer the
question of what the poem’s “attitude” to “earthy love” is.
430 It is all three: the poet enjoys
playing with its inherent ambiguities, and we are to enjoy their interplay.
However, an additional layer of the poem is opened up to us, and love’s ambiguities
elegantly accounted for, if we understand the Gnostic Venus to be subverting Puritanical
doctrine: in her capacity as the Gnostic’s syncretic “Love-Christ,”431 she is promising to be light
as the Biblical Christ claims his burden to be light.432 When she asks, “Is love so light, sweet
boy, and it may it be/That thou should think it heavy unto thee?” (155-156), she is calling
attention to the fact that she, the Neoplatonic Love of the syncretic Gnostic, is light (aspires to
the heavenly) at the same time as she is viewed as heavy (“gross,” 150, and sinking down into
hell) by the Puritan—an inversion of the fact that the Biblical Christ claims his burden to be light
at the same time as it is viewed as heavy by the Gnostic. In keeping with the fact that the
Gnostic’s syncretic system is viewed as incoherent to the Puritan—as well as with Hughes’s
reading to the effect that Venus is meant to function on one level (that of the first veil) as the
Catholic Whore of Babylon, and on another level (that of the veil-beneath-the-veil) as the
perennial Goddess to whose infernal manifestation she is reduced by Adonis’s Puritanical

Jennings 111
misperception—Mortimer observes that as Adonis “hears Venus speak of her own and love’s
lightness, he is actually being pinned to the ground: the goddess is impressive in more ways than
one.”433
Just as at 133-138, Venus expressed incredulity at Adonis’s rejection of the very Goddess
of Love (the Puritan’s rejection of Sophia’s Gnosis), wondering what could possibly be wrong
with her appearance (who wouldn’t want to sleep with the Love Goddess a.k.a. be illumined into
a deity?), so now at 157-162, she assumes the “only beauty which could prevent Adonis from
admiring her must be his own.”434 Puritanism is perhaps bewildering to the outsider (who would
want to be a Puritan?). The point is not that there is anything wrong with her appearance, but that
there is something wrong with that for which her appearance is a facade. She may not appear
“hard-favoured, foul, or wrinkled-old,/Ill-nurtured, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,/O’er-worn,
despisèd, rheumatic, and cold,/Thick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice” (133-136), but the
consequences of loving her will be ugly. She might not appear like that now, but that is her true
appearance beneath the veil, and that is (if we imagine her to be a real female for a second) what
her—and his—new body will look like when cast into the lake of fire for engaging in their
transgressive love affair. Venus can only imagine that his own superior beauty is his reason for
rejecting her: to reject Love, Beauty must be in love with himself. For the Goddess of Love,
asexuality, or wilful abstinence, is not a concept (nor, for the Gnostic, is willingness to wait for
the world to come).

Jennings 112
As the Gnostic sees the Puritan as imprisoned by the Jehovan demiurge in the realm of
shadows, she fittingly accuses him, as it were, of narcissistically kissing his own “shadow,”
which anticipates the Titan incident (175-198):
‘Is thine own heart to thine own face affected?
Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?
Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected;
Steal thine own freedom, and complain on theft.
 Narcissus so himself himself forsook,
 And died to kiss his shadow in the brook. (157-162)
For the Neoplatonist, man is but a shadow of his Ideal self—the Form of Man—and so to be in
love with oneself (as one presently is) is to be in love with a shadow.435 For the Gnostic, the
Puritan is therefore Narcissistic, in that he is in love with the shadow of a shadow, and by loving
his shadow-self he forsakes his true (ideal) self. For Adonis, this accusation of narcissism comes
across as hypocritical (he, a Puritan, is being accused of hypocrisy by a Gnostic, who vainly
ascends to godhood in the here and now without the true and living God’s permission). As
Mortimer points out, one might think her accusation of narcissism is “a bit rich coming from a
woman who has spent the last three stanzas cataloguing her own attractions—especially when
the poem offers no evidence that Adonis is even conscious of his own beauty.”436 Putney
observes that in “keeping the lush inventory of the lady’s charms, Shakespeare made it part of
his comic characterization of Venus by transferring the description from the poet or the lover to
the goddess herself.”437 But beyond its purely comic dimension, we might do well to see

435 Plato, Republic, 514a-517a.
436 Mortimer, 63.
437 Putney, 133.
Jennings 113
Shakespeare’s characterization as consistent with the view that Venus is in some sense supposed
to be the great perennial Goddess but has been reduced by Adonis’s Puritanical misperception to
the role of one trying to be the Goddess she truly is. As Tita French Baumlin writes,
Unlike her Ovidian ancestor, Shakespeare’s Venus must learn how to use the
language of divine seduction, how to be the goddess she is reputed to be; this
process of apotheosis, of learning and growing into the full-fledged Goddess of
Love, mirrors a similar struggle in the inventive process of the new poet.438
Venus will then abruptly shift to moralizing, the reason for which eludes Mortimer.439
The shift is best explained by the fact that she perceives Adonis’s moralism as her true obstacle,
and may suspect that by shifting to a “graver register” and presenting the “issue in essentially
moral terms” she might correct his perception of her as essentially amoral. Her accusation of
narcissism served as a set-up for this shift to moralizing, as it had allowed her to assume the
moral high-ground from which to accuse him of sinful pride (what is for the Puritan the
Gnostic’s turning of things upside down).440 Now she speaks of moral harm (“Things growing to
themselves are growth’s abuse,” 166) and moral obligation (“Thou wast begot; to get it is thy
duty, 168), to conclude her sermon of sorts which expounds on the purpose of things and the
neglect of those purposes (“Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,/Dainties to taste, fresh
beauty for the use,/Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear,” 163-164). Venus’s difficulty
is that the “fertility of ‘sappy plants’ cannot quite correct the impression that Adonis is simply
being constituted as one more object of conspicuous consumption.”441 Mortimer also observes

438 Baumlin, 192.
439 Mortimer, 64.
440 Isaiah 29:16 KJV.
441 Mortimer, 65.
Jennings 114
that the phrase “By law of nature thou art bound to breed” (171) “hovers rather cynically
between enjoining procreation as a duty and presenting it as a biological impulse that leaves him
with no choice.”442 Gnostic libertinism-disguised-as-liberty-and-moral-duty is for the Puritan
enslavement to sin; St. Paul even spoke of sin as having its own law.443
After arguing that Adonis is made for love as “torches are made to light, jewels to wear”
(163), she begins to use quite Biblical language.444 First, she invokes Genesis with the phrase,
“seeds spring from seeds” (167). Then, as John Roe notes, Venus’s rhetorical question, ‘Upon
the earth’s increase why shouldst thou feed,/Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?’ (169-
170) “invokes the command of the Hebrew God with its insistence on duty: ‘Bring forthe frute,
and multiplie, and replenish the earth’ (Gen. 9.1).”445 But he unfortunately concludes, rather
perfunctorily, “The effect of this is to keep serious ideas in view despite the prevailing use of
comedy.”446 We are better rewarded if we see Venus as using quasi-biblical arguments to
impress her Puritan beloved when she is really twisting scripture to replace the Christian doctrine
of immortality with a pagan doctrine of reincarnation (one to which the syncretic Gnostic
subscribes), where Adonis’s only hope at surviving death is through his progeny. It is “by law of
nature” rather than by the divine law of God that Adonis is “bound to breed” (171). If Adonis’s
children should live when he himself is dead, then, according to Venus’s doctrine, “in spite of
death,” he shall “survive” (173)—not in the sense that Christ conquered death so that he might
do the same—but rather, “[i]n that” his “likeness still is left alive” (174).

Jennings 115
This argument actually turns out to be potentially anti-Platonic. That is, it begins as
Neoplatonic but would seem to catch itself in its own trap: Narcissus, vainly mistaking himself
for the ideal form of Man, kisses not just a shadow in the brook but, according to Plato, a shadow
of a shadow, for he is, as are we all, but a shadow of the ideal form of Man. This is all well and
good. But then Venus tells Adonis that he can transcend death in that his “likeness” may still be
“left alive” (174). His “likeness” is not the thing itself, but a mere shadow of the original (an
even further removal from his ideal form). Perhaps the idea (consistent with Gnosticism) is that
the Puritan is narcissistic in that he deifies Man, but not Woman,447 and this neglect of the divine
feminine precludes (by the force of the poet’s metaphorical logic) the only real form of
immortality that is available to him.
Aligning himself with the eroticists, Mortimer reads the Titan episode as little more than
an extension of the reader’s voyeuristic pleasure:
Titan, as voyeur, recalls the eyewitness situation of the narrator and also evokes
the reaction that Shakespeare could have expected from his male readers—
especially ‘the younger sort’ who might envy Adonis the opportunity of being
initiated into the mysteries of sex by an experienced older woman. Such readers,
already made spectators of an erotic performance, are now offered the added
refinement of watching someone watching.448
On one level, the poem certainly functions like this. One could perhaps argue that Shakespeare
renders Venus an older woman specifically to incite this sort of reaction. However, an additional

H. Pagels, The Gnostic Gospels (Vintage, 1989), 48-69.
448 Mortimer, 65-66.
Jennings 116
layer of the poem is opened up if we consider the full range of opportunities which this
unprecedented change affords the poet. As Dubrow notes,
Emphasized by Shakespeare’s repeated references to him [Adonis] as a boy (for
example, ll. 32, 95, 344), his immaturity represents a striking deviation from the
sources. Though Golding once calls his Adonis a “tender youth” (l. 634),
elsewhere he indicates that he has reached manhood, and Ovid explicitly states
that he was “iam iuvenis, iam vir” (“now a youth, now man,” Metamorphoses
X.523).449
By rendering Adonis more youthful and Venus far older than the sources would have them, the
poet avails himself of a series of metaphors in the service of the poem’s Puritanical-Gnostic
structure. The Puritanical Adonis is young (innocent, to the Puritan) whereas Venus is old (no
longer innocent). The Puritanical Adonis, preoccupied by a fear of transience, already sees the
result of Gnosis: he already sees the consequence of lust, the agedness of Venus. Moreover, for
the Gnostic, Venus precedes Adonis in that she, in her capacity as the Gnostic Sophia, is aligned
with the true God from which she has descended to earth. Adonis, in his capacity as the
Puritanical Goddess-repressing god, is her son Jaldabaoth—a younger, more recent, corrupted
manifestation of the Ultimate.450 The Puritanical God claims to be the beginning and the ending,
the first and the last.451 By a startling inversion, here it is the Goddess who is the more ancient of
the two. Furthermore, as Mortimer observes, Shakespeare
established a continuity between the erotic and the pathetic by making the
warning serve as a bridge between the two . . . [Venus] does not play first one role

449 Dubrow, 239.
450 Hughes, 348-356.
451 Revelation 22:13 GNV.
Jennings 117
and then the other, [but rather is] throughout both threatening and protective,
sexually aggressive and maternal . . . [This] creates a basic ambivalence about
Adonis’ response since we are not sure whether surrender to Venus would be an
initiation to manhood or a regression to infancy.452
This signifies the fact that it is unclear whether surrender to the Gnostic Sophia is a means of
progression toward illumination or regression into diabolical obscurity. It also plays on the idea
of the alleged requirement of being born again in order to inherit the kingdom of heaven.453 For
the Puritan, one must become dead to the world in order to be born again.454 For the Gnostic, one
must slay one’s ego in order to be regenerated: one must descend into the primordial depths of
infancy before ascending into the lofty heights of godhood.455 The age distinction between the
two interlocutors lends itself all too well to these doctrinal differences.
This additional layer of the poem is further opened up if we recall that, in the poem’s first
stanza, Adonis is an earthly man whose celestial aspect (whose higher self) is the sun, here called
Titan. This sun, the Form of forms for Plato, is Adonis’s higher illuminated self (what is for the
Gnostic the potential Christ within him), which, contrary to the earthly Adonis (the Puritanical
one), seeks the celestial illumination of the Goddess, as in lines 175-180:
By this, the love-sick queen began to sweat,
For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,
And Titan, tired in the midday heat,
With burning eye did hotly overlook them.

Jennings 118
 Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,
 So he were like him, and by Venus’ side.
Here Adonis’s higher celestial self wishes to receive the illumination of the Goddess, but
Adonis’s terrestrial self refuses to allow the exchange to occur. Here the absurdity of the
Puritan’s rejection of the Goddess is captured with elegant comedy: the Form of Love has
descended from heaven to earth, and the very Form of forms is willing to leave heaven to join
her; the Puritan, for whom the Form of Love descends all the way from heaven to earth in order
to instantiate herself in his very presence, rejects her. Notably, the “shadow,” as anticipated by
Venus’s Narcissus conceit, has a profound Neoplatonic resonance to it, in its sharp contrast with
Adonis (the earthly sun) and Titan (the heavenly sun). This is perhaps emphasized even more in
the following stanza:
‘Ay me,’ quoth Venus, ‘young, and so unkind?
What bare excuses mak’st thou to be gone?
I’ll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind
Shall cool the heat of this descending sun.
 I’ll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;
 If they burn too, I’ll quench them with my tears.’ (187-192)
Here Venus is imagined as protecting Adonis from his higher celestial self, whom Venus claims
to have little effect upon her, when it would seem what Venus is actually doing is trying to get
Adonis to connect with his higher self. She can tell the earthly Puritanical Adonis is
overwhelmed by the Gnostic illumination of his higher self, and so she pretends to protect him
with shadows (for it is, according to the Gnostic, the realm of shadows in which the Jehovan
demiurge has imprisoned him). Venus is the Neoplatonic form of Love, intent on instantiating
Jennings 119
herself in the realm of particulars, an immortal Goddess intent on entering the realm of mortality
(the Gnostic Sophia descending from the Pleromatic center of the heavenly heights to become
the earth for our sake)456 in order to raise the Puritanical Adonis (through Gnosis) into his higher
celestial self, but she is here forced to pretend she is protecting Adonis from the Sun (the
overwhelming Form of forms) with shadows, the particular instantiations of forms, for what is
(from the Gnostic perspective) his own good.457
Venus’s language in the next stanza is most readily understood as mere hyperbole:
‘The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,
And lo, I lie between that sun and thee.
The heat I have from thence doth little harm;
Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me,
 And were I not immortal, life were done
 Between this heavenly and earthly sun. (193-198)
It might appear all Venus is doing is capturing just how beautiful Adonis is. The sun himself has
little effect upon her; it is his “eye” that “darts forth the fire that burneth” her (196). But are we
to simply take her word for it that the sun has little effect upon her? Is she engaging in mere
flattery, or is she, as the Puritan would put it, a devil that savours (or understands) “not the things
that are of God, but the things that are of men”?458 The word “lie,” evocative of Plato’s ‘Noble
Lie,’459 here suggests a subtle admission of duplicity. If the heavenly sun has little effect upon
Venus it is perhaps because the poem imagines her as being singularly moved by the earthly

456 Hughes, 348-356.

Jennings 120
Adonis as one would expect earthly men would be by a celestial Goddess. The poet achieves a
profound paradox here: the immortal sun has little effect upon the immortal Venus, whereas the
mortal Adonis has an effect upon her that would be fatal were she not immortal. But from the
Puritanical perspective she is simply invoking the law of reversal to pretend the Gnostic
illumination of Adonis’s higher self is harmless—going so far as to claim his celestial self is far
less dangerous to him than his earthly one is to her—when devil possession (what it really is) is
anything but benign.
Jennings 121
CONCLUSION: THE CLOSING SPEECH
The radical distinction between the rhetorical style of Venus and that of Adonis, as well
as the content of their speech, presents evidence at the very surface level of the text that further
reinforces the view that Venus embodies the non-doctrinal spirituality of the Gnostic and Adonis
the rigid dogmatism of the Puritanical Biblical literalist. Streitberger writes that
Throughout the debate Adonis acts as an ideal Renaissance schoolboy who has
learned his lesson well. Indeed, he is in the second of the seven ages of man,
noted by Jacques in As You Like It (II.vii.143-66). He rejects Venus’ procreation
argument in terms reminiscent of the grammar school debate.460
T. W. Baldwin confirms this view by noting Erasmus’s recommendation of the subject for the
practice of rhetoric, and by documenting how common it was for schoolboys to debate the
question of procreation via marriage through the rhetorical practice of weighing its pros and
cons.461 Mortimer also notes this striking difference in rhetorical style. He writes that the
“rhetoric of Venus is opportunistic and infinitely flexible, short on logic but strong on invention,
expansive, all-embracing, taking whatever offers as grist to her mill.”462 Adonis’s rhetorical
style, by contrast, is “relatively even in tone, tightly organized, antithetical and aphoristic—the
opposite of expansive, concerned with making rather than blurring distinctions,” as in 799-804,
where Adonis repeatedly reinforces the distinctions between lust and love which Venus will only
blur throughout the poem.463

But Mortimer perceives more in Adonis’s rhetorical style than the mere embodiment of a
“diligent and priggish schoolboy reciting a well-learned lesson.”464 The “clipped and rigorous
symmetries of the syntax and the predictability of the antitheses convey Adonis’ need to find
security in a scheme of moral certainties, rigid boundaries and mutually absolute exclusions.”465
This is the Puritan to a tee. Whereas a “rhetorical education” more generally “might encourage a
relativist outlook that would place any orthodoxy at risk,”466 Puritanism keeps its rhetoric binary
to preserve its orthodoxy from the relativist outlook which the unrestrained practice of rhetoric
might facilitate. In line with this, Dubrow writes that as we read the words “Love comforteth like
sunshine after rain,/But lust’s effect is tempest after sun;/Love’s gentle spring doth always fresh
remain,/Lust’s winter comes ere summer half be done” (799-802), “we sense a tension between
their neatness, the sense of intellectual and poetic stasis that they convey, and the rapidly
moving, unpredictable world we encounter elsewhere in the poem.”467 Catherine Belsey even
confirms the view that the poet’s sympathies lie with the Goddess and not the Puritan when she
observes that the narrator’s synonymous use of “love” and “lust” to capture Venus’s passion
reflects pre-Protestant attitudes, whereas Adonis’s rigid restrictions at 793-804 reflect those
made by Protestantism through its revaluation of marriage.468
Adonis’s most lengthy speech (769-810) even prompts Hamilton to quip that “Adonis is
more rigorous than the compromising Church Fathers.”469 Here the Puritanical Adonis
acknowledges the Gnostic Venus as a temptation, but he is suspicious of her as he would say Eve

should have been of the honey-tongued serpent.470 He compares her to the “wanton mermaid”
when he accuses her of like bewitchment (777). He acknowledges the fact that her “tune” is a
“tempting” one but he says it is fated to be ever “blown” from his “ear” (778), for his “heart
stands armed in [his] ear,/And will not let a false sound enter there” (779-780). He is well aware
the “path is smooth that leadeth on to danger” (788), for he has read the words, “wide is the gate,
and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat.”471 He
implicitly distinguishes Venus from that which she is supposedly a Goddess of, that of which she
is supposedly an embodiment, in the hypothetical line, “If love have lent you twenty thousand
tongues” (775), as if to distinguish her from what she (on his view) pretends to be. He labels her
“harmony” as “deceiving” (781), and appears to be aware of what will happen if it “should
run/Into the quiet closure of [his] breast” (781-782)—for “then” his “little heart were quite
undone,/In his bedchamber to be barred of rest” (783-784). How he knows this is not made
explicit, for he admits to having had no experience of love (409-414). He ‘knows not love,’ but
he has “heard” some nasty things about it (414). Given that, for him, love is lust’s disguise, the
place he must have heard about it is the Bible. Moreover, that he loves to disgrace love echoes
the fact that he loves to hunt love (4), and captures the Puritan’s predilection for exposing
darkness and reproving evil (“What have you urged that I cannot reprove?” 787).472

Many critics have commented on the lack of sophistication in Adonis’s speech,473 but
Mortimer acknowledges the rhetorical potency and elegant pithiness in his aphoristic delivery,474
and Dubrow compares it rather favorably to the “couplets in Shakespeare’s sonnets.”475 Dubrow
observes that of the poem’s 1,194 lines, “537 are spoken by the goddess of love.”476 Whereas
Venus is voluble and expansive, Adonis, as Coppélia Kahn notes, “speaks only eighty-eight
lines,”477 which is perhaps significant given Jesus’s name is 888 in Greek Isopsephy (a cryptic
confirmation for Hughes’s reading of Adonis as a ‘Gnostic’ inversion of the Puritanical godman). Whereas Venus’s speech is complex and rife with ambiguity, Adonis’s speech is simple,
straightforward, and binary, but no less rhetorically impressive: his speech represents that of the
Bible (characterized as it is by such binaries as light versus darkness, good versus evil, God
versus the devil)—a library of books whose writers (it must be admitted by the objective critic)
are masters of rhetoric. But while Adonis is rhetorically impressive in his own way, Lucy Gent’s
qualification must be heeded: “[e]uphuistic elements of Adonis’s style are out of date for the
1590’s.”478 The poet may thus be understood as traiting the Puritanical Adonis as one unlikeable
as well as old-fashioned. He is simultaneously young (to represent his Puritanical ‘innocence,’
his status as one who has not yet been initiated into Gnosis) and ‘old’ (to represent his Biblical
conservativism): for he himself is “green” though his text be “old.” This speech of Adonis’s at
769-810, which reinforces all too clearly the antithetical structure I have proposed, recalls the

Identity (Amherst: U of Massachusetts P, 1992), 141; Lucy Gent, Picture and Poetry, 1560-

following scripture, which may serve to summarize it (as well as the whole poem from the
Puritan’s perspective): “But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his
subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ” (my
emphasis).479
In sum, I have shown that the poem’s antithetical structure actually lends itself to two
diametrically opposed hermeneutical tendencies which, fittingly, manifests itself (to a striking
degree) in the poem’s critical divide. I have shown that simplistic allegorical and moralistic
readings which sympathize with the chaste Adonis and inveigh against Venus fail to take into
consideration the eroticists’ recognition of i) the poem’s celebration of eros, and ii) the many
strong indications that the poet’s sympathies ultimately lie with Venus, as well as the iii) myriad
ambivalences which the readers occupying the middle ground apprehend. I have further
uncovered much of the poem’s allegorical dimension, whose existence the eroticists and the
humorists deny to the reader’s detriment. I have also shown that the ‘intentional ambivalence’
camp, while perceptive enough to see the poem as anything but simple, ultimately satisfies itself
with an unsatisfying conclusion. The epistemological framework I have offered allows the reader
to see the poem’s ambivalences as manifestations of the clash between the hermeneutical
tendency expressed by Venus and that expressed by Adonis. Each hermeneutical tendency
‘reads’ the opposing hermeneutical tendency in a specific manner, and it is this clash that may
best explain the poem’s ostensibly irresolvable oppositions. I have even shown how the one
hermeneutical tendency (the Venus tendency) expressed in Hughes’s radically allegorical
reading may be synergized with the opposing hermeneutical tendency (the Adonis tendency)
expressed in Mortimer’s allegoresis-abjecting literalistic reading, in order to not only yield

Jennings 126
fruitful insights into the poem but, moreover, actually confute Mortimer’s attempted repudiation
of allegoresis.
While I think I have validated my proposed reading method at the level of “free”
particulars via my close sequential reading of the poem’s first 204 lines, I have not had the space
to demonstrate how the entire poem might be read through the antithetical ‘Puritanical-Gnostic’
lens I have offered. Moreover, I have not had the space to tease out as many doctrinal nuances
from the endlessly complicated webs of ‘Puritanism’ and ‘Gnosticism’ as I would have liked to.
Also, with more space, I could have built a stronger historicist case for my reading method. But
overall, while one could perhaps disagree with my choice of terms, and differ with me on matters
of fine detail, I think I have succeeded in uncovering a clear antithetical structure forged between
two diametrically opposed hermeneutical tendencies, which not only offers fruitful insights into
the poem, but which may further illuminate and even ameliorate, if not completely resolve, the
poem’s hitherto irreconcilable critical divide.
