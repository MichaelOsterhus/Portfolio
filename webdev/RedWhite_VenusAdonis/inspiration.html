        <h2>Shakespeare's Inspiration</h2>
        <p>Shakespeare inaugurates his 'Venus and Adonis' with a Latin quote from the Roman poet Horace:</p>
        <p class="quote shake">
            Vilia miretur vulgus: mihi flavus Apollo

            Pocula Castalia plena ministret aqua.

        </p>
        <p>Translation:</p>
        <p class="quote shake">
            Let the vulgar crowd admire cheap things; let yellow Apollo

            Serve me with cups full of Castalian water.

        </p>
        <p>The last part of the quote alludes to the Castalian spring
            at Delphi where Apollo killed Python and established his oracle.  The spring was associated with prophecy
            and poetic inspiration.
            
            </p>
        <p>Even if Shakespeare's poem was divinely inspired, it wasn't created ex nihilo. 
            It is believed that Shakespeare based his poem
            primarily on a tale of the two deities in Ovid's 'Metamorphoses' (8 CE) though he may have been inspired
            by other stories in the same book for transformation myths centering on a love pursuit is a common motif in
            the book and in  
            Greco-Roman mythology in general.  Not surprisingly, Metamorphoses, was a source of inspiration for Alchemists, 
            as Harvard classicist, Edward 
            Kennard Rand, is quoted in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.academia.edu/168303/_Ovid_and_the_Alchemists_">Ovid and the Alchemists</a>
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            Ovid’s text is made a quarry for the alchemist’s pick and shovel … The 
            fable of Deucalion and Pyrrha, for instance, betokens, like the twin peaks 
            of Parnassus, the masculine and the feminine elements among the metals, 
            that is, gold and silver, from the union of which the philosopher’s stone 
            is produced. In this fashion, the whole poem is subjected to the fatal touch 
            of Midas; Ovid’s gold is converted into the baser metal.
        </p> There are at least 3 transformation myths centering on a nymph or goddess pursuing
            a man she is in love with in Ovid's Metamorphoses:
            <ol>
                <li>Venus and Adonis</li>
                <li>Echo and Narcissus</li>
                <li>Salmacis and Hermaphroditus</li>

            </ol>
            The similarity between the first two gives cause to believe they are variations of the same myth.  The third differs in 
            such a way that it can't go without mentioning.   
            </p>
            <h3>Salmacis and Hermaphroditus</h3>
            <p>
            This story is similar to Ovid's tale of Venus and Adonis but for that the man being chased by an adoring woman, 
            doesn't die, not in the literal sense, nor does a flower grow in the spot he died.  Rather, when Salmacis sees Hermaphroditus 
            bathing in the spring she haunted, being immediately enraptured, she wraps herself around him and prays to 
            the gods that she and the son of Hermes and Aphrodite should never part. The gods grant her request, 
            fusing the two beings into one body, a single being both male and female. One question that appears begging to be asked
            is: is the merging of male and female into one what Adonis had in store had he chosen to love Venus instead of going hunting?
            Is that the meaning of the red and white flower that springs from his blood?</p>

                <p>On left: from the Alchemical manuscript, Splendor Solis (1582), depiction of a Hermaphrodite in the three principle colors of 
                    Alchemy, black, white, and red.  Red and white here coloring the wings as if to imply having both forms makes 
                    the being divine.  The being holds what is apparently meant to represent the Philosopher's Stone in the semblance of an egg.
                    The image in the book is adjacent a parable on how the Stone is like an egg, uniting the 4 opposites (hot/cold, dry/wet) into one.

            </div>

            <p>
                In Ovid's telling of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus, red and white appear together also, only briefly, when Salmacis attempts 
                to gain affection and causes Hermaphroditus to blush:
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
                ‘After this the naiad was silent. A <span class="red">red</span> flush branded the boy’s face. He did not know what love was: 
                though the <span class="red">blush</span> was very becoming. <span class="red">Apples</span> are tinged with this colour, hanging in a sunlit tree, 
                or <span class="white">ivory</span> painted with <span class="red">red</span>, 
                or the <span class="white">moon</span>, eclipsed, <span class="red">blushing</span> in her brightness, 
                while the <span class="red">bronze</span> shields clash, 
                in vain, to rescue her. 

            </p>
            <p>Note that here Ovid is comparing Hermaphroditus to a damsel in distress in the Moon who blushes because men are fighting to rescue 
                her.  Shakespeare gives Adonis a similar treatment when he writes: 
            </p>
            <p class="quote shake">
                He burns with bashful shame; she with her tears
                Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks.
                Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs
                To fan and blow them dry again she seeks.
                  He saith she is immodest, blames her miss;
                  What follows more she murders with a kiss.
            </p>

            <h4>The Sun's Eye of Passion</h4>
            <p class="quote shake">
                The nymph’s eyes blazed with passion, 
                as when (the Sun's) likeness is reflected from a mirror, 
                that opposes his brightest unclouded orb. 
                She can scarcely wait, scarcely contain her delight, 
                now longing to hold him, 
                now unable to keep her love to herself.

                He cheers the morn and all the earth relieveth;

        <!-- <p>One thing that potentially relates this story to that of Adonis is that Hermaphroditus is the son of Aphrodite.  The most
            renowned son of Aphrodite is of course he whom the Greeks called Eros, and the Romans, Cupid.  Typically known as the god of Love,
             in some myths Eros is not just Love, but the Love which created the Universe by copulating with the primordial Chaos,
            as can be seen in Aristophanes play, 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0026%3Acard%3D685">Birds</a>. 
            This role potentially links him with what could be called the Divine Hermaphrodite, 
            a generic term for the primordial unity which split into 
            Heaven and Earth, Fire and Water, Sun and Moon, the masculine and feminine aspects of Alchemy.
        </p> -->
        <p>Hermaphroditus was a popular deity among the Greeks (Hermaphroditos in Greek) and Romans, and there are many statues carved in veneration.
             Interestingly,
            the common depiction of the being described as both male and female is as a woman with a penis and testicles.
            Recall that in the Orphic
            hymn to Adonis, the deity is called 'Female and Male', but in the Orphic hymns Adonis is not the only deity described so.

        <p>The concept of a hermaphrodite like what is depicted above, what we call a transgender woman, was not foreign to 
            Shakespeare.  Indeed, the Bard dedicated a good portion of his sonnets to such a person, though it doesn't become obvious until 
            Sonnet 20 where Shakespeare makes it known the man he's been writing to was meant to be a woman but given a penis by 
            a-doting Nature that he should give women pleasure.
        </p>
        <p class="quote shake">
            A woman’s face with nature’s own hand painted
            Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;
            A woman’s gentle heart, but not acquainted
            With shifting change as is false women’s fashion;
            An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
            Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
            A man in hue, all hues in his controlling,
            Which steals men’s eyes and women’s souls amazeth.
            And for a woman wert thou first created,
            Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,
            And by addition me of thee defeated
            By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
              But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,
              Mine be thy love and thy love’s use their treasure.
        </p>
        <p>Though the Sacred Marriage is the subject of neither Shakespeare's poem nor Ovid's tale, not explicitly, both leave a clue. 
            Neither author have Venus and Adonis end up
            in the Bridal Chamber, instead both have Adonis end up dead, a flower grown from his blood. So Shakespeare says:
        </p>
        <p class="quote shake">
            And in his blood that on the ground lay spill’d,
            A purple flower sprung up, chequer’d with white;   
              Resembling well his pale cheeks, and the blood
              Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that Shakespeare uses purple here to denote the color of blood.  In his time purple wasn't restricted to the 
            hue it is now and could be used for a range of hue including dark or rich reds.
            Shake uses purple three times in the poem, first to describe the face of the setting sun, 
            then twice more to mean the color of blood. Ovid similarly 
            tells us the flower is a "blood-colored anemone", leaving us with one species of flower as an obvious candidate.
        </p>
        <img width="700" src="img/anemone.png">
        <p> The anemone coronaria "crown anemone" known for its black crown.  The flower blooms in a variety of colors, 
            but there is a peculiar variant with petals that transition from white to red.  A flower native to the Mediterranean,
            its name is supposed to derive from the Greek <i>anemone</i>,
            "windflower".  Ovid is in agreement stating the flower is "too easily fallen, the winds deflower it, 
            which are likewise responsible for its name, windflower" though other sources say it is so called because the 
            flower will not bloom until it has been touched by the wind.
            Some believe the name anemone comes from the Arabic name of this particular flower, shaqa'iq An-Nu'man (wounds of An-Nu'man).
            The Red Crown Anemone is the national flower of Israel.
        </p>



        <p>
            Even if Venus and Adonis don't end up merging into one flesh in Shakespeare's poem, the red and white flower that remains
            at the tragic conclusion 
            may stand  
            as a picture, an anticipation of Adonis' return and the reunion of red and white.  Indeed, 
            the number of times these two colors appear in Shakespeare's poem, one might think they were its subject.
            To see why this might be the case we turn now to Alchemy.
