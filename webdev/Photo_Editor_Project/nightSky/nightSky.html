        <p id="p-1">`The night sky image below is a bitmap image made using JavaScript
         and the HTML canvas element.  The colors of the grid of squares meant to 
         represent pixels are a mix of randomly generated red, green, and blue
         values within certain parameters. If you refresh the page/image, you will see
         a different "night sky".`,
        
         `This product of code was made for illustrating how bitmap images work 
         and during the course of the presentation I will explain the code I used to build 
         it as a way of explaining bitmap.`,
        
         `Originally, a bitmap image, basically a grid of squares known as pixels, 
         was attributed a single bit of data per square.
         Typically depicted as a 1 or 0, a bit is the smallest piece of data used by a computer. 
         So it was, one bit per pixel was used in the past for monochrome monitors 
         in which each pixel bit corresponded to a pixel on the screen which was either on or off, 
         lit or dark, one color or no color.`,
        
         `Bitmap images account for most but not all images you see
         on the internet.  Also known as raster images, today they come in many file types such as
         JPEG, PNG, GIF, and BMP. With bitmap images such as these is not unusual for a single 
         pixel to be given not a bit, but 3 (to 4) bytes of data with one byte for the red, green, blue, (and alpha) values `,
        
         `A bitmap image is not unlike the map below.  This world map is divided up into a grid which is 24 squares wide
         and 12 squares tall, equaling 288 squares in total. In comparison, this world map 
         is also a bitmap image, and as such is 600px wide by 300px tall. Meaning, for every visible square in this map, 
         there are 625 pixels.  `,
        
         `For the sake of understanding, we will start with most basic element. `,
        
         `With the above line of code we are creating a variable using the keyword 'let'
         and setting it equal to an array which contains the numbers 0 and 1.  The term 'bit' here
         is arbitrarily designated but because it names a variable, we can use it elsewhere, such as
         in the code below:`,
        
         `Here we create another variable and assign to it the length of the array we just made. 
         In JS, 'length' is another keyword and it refers to the number of values in an array. 
         Hence, because there are two numbers in our array, the length of 'bit' = 2.`,
        
         `A byte is 8 bits put together to make a single value. If a bit has 2 possible values,
         how many possible values then does a byte have? `,
        
         `Using JavaScript, I've defined a variable I've called 'bit' and set it equal to an array
         containing 2 values, 0 and 1.  Seeing that the next variable 'bitValue' equals 2--the 
         "length" (number of values) of the 'bit' array, and our variable 'byte' equals 8,
          then byteValue equals 2^8 or 256 possible values for a byte.`,
        
         `Now, I can make an array for byte like I have for bit, but I don't want to 
         type a bunch of 0s and 1s. So, I created an empty byteArray, then used a "for loop" 
         so that while the iterator 'i' is less than the value of 'byte' it will push a copy 
         of the 'bit' array into the byteArray, yielding the result below`,
        
         `JavaScript can generate a random number between 0 and 1`,
        
         `Because I'm using JavaScript to append this text to the page,
                  this randomly generated number...`,
         
         `...will update
         everytime you refresh the page.`,
         
         `Using the 'byteArray' I've just made, I can create a new array I call 'randomByteArray' 
         in the same manner except I can use JavaScript's "random" method to have the computer
         randomly choose between the 0 and 1 from each "bit" in 'byteArray' before it is pushed to the new array.
         Arrays made using the push method are created dynamically and not stored in the source code.  Hence, the 
         randomly generated "byte" below will be made new everytime the page is refreshed.`,
        
         `Bitmap is a type of digital image, also called raster. 
        It is the image type typically associated with digital photos.
        There are several bitmap file types including JPEG, PNG, TIF, 
        and others.`,
         
         `Now pixels in bitmap images are given 3 BYTES of data (or in some cases 4)
           one byte per color channel in the RGB color system.  In the current
           system the Red, Green, and Blue channel each have a range of 256 
           values which totals a range of ${totalColor} colors.`</p>

        <p>In the second map, the squares from the first have been reinterpreted using JavaScript to represent 
           what the image would look like if it were 24px x 12px. It is not part of the tutorial but you can see
           the JS code </p>
