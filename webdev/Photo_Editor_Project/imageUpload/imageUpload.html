    <h2>Upload Image and Draw to Canvas</h2>
    <p>In this HTML markup, we have added an input element of type file, 
        which allows the user to select an image file. We have also created a canvas element with an id of "canvas".</p>

        <p>>Next, we will use JavaScript to add functionality to the file input element 
            and draw the selected image on the canvas.</p>
      <input type="file" id="fileInput" />
      <canvas id="canvas"></canvas>
