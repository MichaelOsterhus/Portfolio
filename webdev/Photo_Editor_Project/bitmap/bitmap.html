        <h1>Photo-editor Project: Introduction To Bitmap Images</h1>
        <p>As part of building a photo editor, it is important to understand the thing we will be editing, a bitmap image.</p>
        <p> In terms of digital images, there are two basic image types: vector and bitmap, aka raster.  While both vector and bitmap
         can come in different file types, they work in fundamentally different ways.  
         
         Vector images are made up of mathematical equations or expressions that describe shapes and lines in the image.
         These shapes and lines can either be filled with colors or gradients, or given a stroke, 
         i.e. a visualized line that runs along the path of the mathematically mapped line.
         
         Bitmap images, on the other hand, map a 
         grid of squares called pixels, from "picture + element", and are the smallest element of a bitmap image. 
         Pixels contain specific color values and correspond to pixels on a display device such as a computer 
         monitor or smartphone screen.  the size and resolution of the image and the screen can affect how the image appears 
         and whether it looks sharp and clear or pixelated and blurry.
         
         Originally, pixels were only give one bit of data, 
         they were either on or off, lit or dark.
         So, this map of pixels was orignally a map of bits, but nowadays they are a map of bytes of data,
         typically 3 bytes (24-bit) or 4 bytes (32-bit).

         This data, of course, is accessible, and it is by accessing this data and manipulating it that 
         digital photo-editing is possible.

         What Data is Contained in a Bitmap Image?

         Each pixel in a bitmap image is represented by a set of color values. 
         These values can be represented in different ways, depending on the file format of the image. 
         For example, in a 24-bit bitmap image, each pixel is represented by three values: 
         one for red, one for green, and one for blue (RGB). 
         These values are often represented as numbers between 0 and 255, 
         with 0 being the darkest and 255 being the brightest.  The extra byte of data in 32-bit images (RGBA)
         is for the alpha channel, giving 256 possible values for a pixel's opacity or transparency. 

         In addition to the RGB, or RGBA values, bitmap images also contain information about the size of the image, 
         the resolution (or number of pixels per inch), and other metadata such as the date
         the image was created and the software used to create it.

         What Can We Do with Bitmap Image Data?

         With the data contained in a bitmap image, we can perform a wide variety of image 
         processing tasks. For example, we can change the color values of individual pixels 
         to create special effects, or we can blur or sharpen specific areas of the image. 
         We can also use algorithms to automatically detect and correct problems with the image, 
         such as noise or distortion.

         In addition to image processing, bitmap image data can also be used for computer 
         vision tasks such as object recognition or face detection. By analyzing the color 
         values and patterns in the pixels, we can train machine learning algorithms to identify 
         specific objects or features within the image.

         Conclusion

         Bitmap images are an important part of digital imaging, and understanding the data they 
         contain can help us create powerful image processing and computer vision applications. 
         In the next article, we'll explore how to load and manipulate bitmap images using JavaScript, 
         so stay tuned!

         In a bitmap image, each pixel is represented by a set of color values, as I mentioned 
         in the previous draft. These color values determine the appearance of the pixel in the image. 
         When we display a bitmap image on a screen, each pixel in the image is 
         mapped to a corresponding pixel on the screen.

            Bitmap images account for most but not all images you see
            on the internet.  Also known as raster images, today they come in many file types such as
            JPEG, PNG, GIF, and BMP. With bitmap images such as these is not unusual for a single 
            pixel to be given not a bit, but 3 (to 4) bytes of data with one byte for the red, green, blue, (and alpha) values 
         </p>
      
         <p>
            A bitmap image is not unlike the map below.  This world map is divided up into a grid which is 24 squares wide
            and 12 squares tall, equaling 288 squares in total. In comparison, this world map 
            is also a bitmap image, and as such is 600px wide by 300px tall. Meaning, for every visible square in this map, 
            there are 625 pixels.  
         </p>
        <p>
         For the sake of understanding, we will start with most basic element.
        </p>
        <p>
         With the above line of code we are creating a variable using the keyword 'let'
         and setting it equal to an array which contains the numbers 0 and 1.  The term 'bit' here
         is arbitrarily designated but because it names a variable, we can use it elsewhere, such as
         in the code below:
        </p>
        <p>
         Here we create another variable and assign to it the length of the array we just made. 
         In JS, 'length' is another keyword and it refers to the number of values in an array. 
         Hence, because there are two numbers in our array, the length of 'bit' = 2.
        </p>
         <p>
          A byte is 8 bits put together to make a single value. If a bit has 2 possible values,
         how many possible values then does a byte have? 
         </p>
         <p>
         Using JavaScript, I've defined a variable I've called 'bit' and set it equal to an array
         containing 2 values, 0 and 1.  Seeing that the next variable 'bitValue' equals 2--the 
         "length" (number of values) of the 'bit' array, and our variable 'byte' equals 8,
          then byteValue equals 2^8 or 256 possible values for a byte.
         </p>
        
        <p>
         Now, I can make an array for byte like I have for bit, but I don't want to 
         type a bunch of 0s and 1s. So, I created an empty byteArray, then used a "for loop" 
         so that while the iterator 'i' is less than the value of 'byte' it will push a copy 
         of the 'bit' array into the byteArray, yielding the result below
        </p>
         
      <p>Bitmap is a type of digital image, also called raster. 
         It is the image type typically associated with digital photos.
         There are several bitmap file types including JPEG, PNG, TIF, 
         and others.</p>  
   
      <p>Now pixels in bitmap images are given 3 BYTES of data (or in some cases 4)
         one byte per color channel in the RGB color system.  In the current
         system the Red, Green, and Blue channel each have a range of 256 
         values which totals a range of ${totalColor} colors.`</p>

        <p id="p-2">  `Originally, a bitmap image, basically a grid of squares known as pixels, 
         was attributed a single bit of data per square.
         Typically depicted as a 1 or 0, a bit is the smallest piece of data used by a computer. 
         So it was, one bit per pixel was used in the past for monochrome monitors 
         in which each pixel bit corresponded to a pixel on the screen which was either on or off, 
         lit or dark, one color or no color.`,</p>
      
 
        <p>In the second map, the squares from the first have been reinterpreted using JavaScript to represent 
           what the image would look like if it were 24px x 12px. It is not part of the tutorial but you can see
           the JS code <a href="https://github.com/MichaelOsterhus/michaelosterhus.github.io/blob/8b445e9ff7a6e20cb29d31d4fe8071f008d7d7fd/webdev/Bitmap_Presentation/map.js" target="_blank">here</a></p>
        
  
       <pre><code>
           let bit = [0, 1];
