      <h2>Puzzle App</h2>
      <h2>The Goal</h2>
      <p>The goal here to is cut an uploaded image into a grid, scramble the pieces, and have the user rearrange them.</p>
      <h3>Phase 1:</h3>
      
      <p>First I wanted to be able to make a grid of draggable squares.</p>
      <div id="playField">
         <div class="grid"></div>
         <btn id="jumble">Jumble</btn>
         
      </div>
      <h3>Phase 2</h3>
      <p>uploading an image.</p>
      <div id="image"></div>
      <p>Keeping things simple, I crop the image as a square and put it to a canvas element.</p>
      <canvas id="display"></canvas>
      <p>The canvas is then cut up in squares which are then used as the background image for 64 div elements, and put into an array
         which can be rearranged.
      </p>
      <div class="gamegrid" id="first"></div>
      <p>Take the squares which are now in an array, shuffle the array and redraw the squares.</p>
      <div class="gamegrid" id="second"></div>
