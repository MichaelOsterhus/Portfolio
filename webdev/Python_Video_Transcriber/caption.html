    <p>if you could take your seats please
        thank you uh
        great pleasure to be back in Carmen Hall
        uh and I just realized that the first
        section I ever taught has his reunion
        so
        it's incredible uh
        crazy I don't know how I survived those
        guys but I did it it's awesome uh so
        welcome my name is Kareem makani faculty
        member here at HBS been here 17 years
        and uh it's a real treat to be here with
        you I think the dean shukon set the
        stage for all the things that we're
        doing about AI I'm going to try to make
        this
        um a bit of some work and research I've
        been doing
        um on AI make it interactive a bit with
        you guys as well I need your feedback on
        a few things
        and then uh we'll talk a little bit
        about the Institute that we have just
        launched here as well and invite you to
        engage with us on that as well
        so the title is competing in the age of
        AI I think uh is based on a book that I
        wrote with Marco Antonio who's also a
        colleague here the book came out in 2020
        January
        uh just before the these events that
        we've all forgotten that happen to all
        of us uh and
        um uh I think we were ahead of our time
        with the title at least you'll judge if
        the content is useful or not but
        certainly with the title we felt like we
        were trying to make sense of the world
        in this way uh and so what I want to do
        though is sort of take you back to 1992.
        okay and I'm going to show you some
        commercials uh that were airing at that
        time so this almost 30 years ago
        and as you watch these commercials this
        keep track of what they got right and
        what they got wrong okay and the quality
        of the commercials is like from 1992
        okay
        have you ever borrowed a book
        from thousands of miles away
        across the country
        without stopping for directions
        or send someone a fax
        from the beach
        you will and the company that'll bring
        it to you a t
        have you ever paid a toll
        without slowing down
        all right
        concert tickets
        from the cash machines
        or tucked your baby in
        from a phone
        maybe they'll bring it to you A T and T
        have you ever opened doors
        the sound of your voice
        prepared your medical history in quality
        so this is where we stand on the atrium
        we're attended a meeting
        [Music]
        you will
        the company that'll bring it to you a t
        okay what do you guys think
        I think they got the future right 30
        years ago right 30 years ago they
        predicted the future except for
        ATT uh
        uh now oh man there's no these
        commercials came on Sunday morning shows
        right
        uh so you know when there were only four
        or five TV channels
        1992 right there with that many TV
        channels so lots of people watched these
        shows and
        um the interesting thing about these
        commercials is that probably the board
        saw this the c-suite saw this the chief
        marketing officer was phenomenal to get
        Tom Selleck to come into the commercials
        right and they predicted the future
        perfectly and you wonder like what was
        happening inside the organization where
        they perfectly predicted the future but
        none of it came true for them
        right uh people like you guys were in
        those organizations at that time all
        right so
        um
        uh you know nobody's off the hook here
        come on
        um so we can laugh at them but you know
        there were probably some HBS alums in
        there
        um uh of course the future was not
        brought by ATT it was brought by sort of
        these companies and by the way if you go
        to YouTube and sort of look for these
        commercials there's like 20 minutes of
        these commercials and every single thing
        that we take for granted today they
        predicted perfectly the form was off
        like you know phone booths right and so
        forth but but the function the function
        was perfectly predicted okay but what
        what what brought this future were these
        types of companies in front of us and
        there are three things about these
        companies that you should pay attention
        to the first is of course they're
        digital through and through second is
        they have ai at the core of the
        operations that they do and the third is
        that they're they go to market in terms
        of ecosystems right instead of being
        vertically integrated many of them are
        platforms and they work that way and
        that logic of platforms digital through
        and through AI at the core has been a
        new logic that has basically emerged in
        the last 20 years
        and so it's worth it to sort of think
        about what this all means for us as we
        enter this century and this sort of this
        age of AI
        and so the my favorite quote is from
        William Gibson is a great sci-fi author
        uh the future's already here it's just
        not evenly distributed yet
        right and this is an important skill to
        have to sort of look around you see
        companies see cultures see people living
        in the future doing things that seem
        weird
        outside of your industry and go I wonder
        if this is the future and what does it
        mean for us to bring it back right and
        so this exercise is just a useful tool
        to look around and build your own
        sensibility of what it means to be
        inhabiting the future and actually
        inventing the future as well
        and so now our sort of time travel uh
        with me to June 2003 right so about 20
        years ago uh the reality is most MBA
        students today are like they were like
        toddlers or something like they want to
        talk about this or like what are you
        talking about
        um but I think you guys can you guys can
        go back right to 2003 right and just
        think about what was happening in the
        world
        and what kind of companies existed what
        you guys cared about what you imagined
        the future to be right and and certainly
        the the stock market this is from
        Wikipedia uh basically showed you know
        one software company Microsoft you know
        264 billion dollars meant valuation but
        conglomers GE I started my career at GE
        and I'm gutted that GE is no longer
        relevant as a company right GE is a
        conglomerate was number two oil and gas
        Walmart Health Care Banking jnj and so
        on and so forth
        um I think the big headline was like AOL
        and uh and Time Warner were going to
        merge
        remember that was that was the big that
        was the big big merger conversation
        um and so this is this is the era there
        and and now if you sort of
        take your older self and talk to your
        younger self
        there's some things you'd be saying to
        this person this younger person right
        there are companies that are worth
        trillions of dollars not just billions
        but trillions of dollars in market cap
        there are companies that effortlessly
        serve billions of users
        billions of users right that we came out
        of a two and a half year or whatever
        Bond pandemic
        where we were trapped in our basements
        right and our attics and our bathrooms
        and yet the world of business went on
        and even thrived
        if you talk that to yourself in O3 that
        this is possible you would say this
        sounds like science fiction
        and then equally important that two
        companies
        one in Berlin one in Germany and one
        here about a mile away from here moderna
        biontec and moderna came up with this
        new revolutionary drug technology that
        solved the vaccine problem for covid in
        basically six months time
        six months time right and if you
        remember the start of the pandemic most
        of the traditional manufacturers for
        vaccines were saying years
        and these guys did it in six months time
        and so it sounds like science fiction
        but we basically edged ourselves into
        this world in just 20 years
        right and if you sort of take that
        perspective then we're sort of already
        living in the future
        right we're already living in the future
        and the numbers are stunning
        right
        of course market cap isn't everything
        right but it's something
        right
        2 trillion two trillion two trillion 1.5
        trillion 1.2 trillion almost a trillion
        half a billion half a billion half a
        billion half a billion okay and besides
        aramco and uh and Hathaway uh Berkshire
        Hathaway everybody else is a digital AI
        native company
        right everybody has sort of our Pension
        funds your Investments our hedge funds
        are betting on these companies for the
        future
        okay and so this is this is the world
        we're in now and it's hard to ignore
        this and what it means for all of you
        individually for your careers for the
        companies you're part of but also for us
        as a as a community and also for HBS as
        well
        and so um when we think about these
        types of companies they seem to follow
        what what has been described as a
        exponential processes in terms of their
        growth in terms of their their their
        their their their ability to to gain uh
        customers and the ability to scale right
        and this great book by azim Azar the
        exponential age really gets at a bunch
        of Technologies and how they're
        impacting society and azim's main
        argument here is to say that there's a
        bunch of technologies that grow
        exponentially a bunch of organizations
        that go exponentially with them and then
        there's the rest of us and the rest of
        us grow linearly
        right and that creates a massive Gap
        right we're feeling this Gap today in
        many many of our organizations
        right so I keep telling the dean he
        doesn't listen to me right
        our biggest competitor is not not
        Stanford or MIT or Wharton or Chicago or
        whatever
        right they're irrelevant to our
        competitors that our competitor is
        LinkedIn learning
        right with 300 million people on
        LinkedIn learning alone
        300 million people right and so it
        depends what game you want to play
        there's a set of companies that are
        playing in this exponential game and
        then the rest of us that grow linearly
        and that creates issues for all of us
        and that's what we're going to try to
        unpack what does this mean what kind of
        company can grow this way how do we then
        think about the consequences for us
        going forward
        so we talk about this age of AI
        and uh I first want to sort of put this
        into context
        um uh this is a portrait uh that was of
        course is an AI talk so of course
        created by AI uh for those of you that
        are art historians or took art classes I
        was an engineer so I had no idea but um
        you know this is a this is a early
        Rembrandt but it was generated by a
        machine okay and so uh let's just watch
        a few minutes of a video that sort of
        showed how this Rembrandt came about and
        as you watch this video like
        and you see the process that they
        followed right it's the same process
        that undergoes much of what happens
        inside of organizations for machine
        Learning Systems as well okay
        one of his great achievements one of
        remembrance great achievements was to
        portray human emotions in a much more
        convincing way than artists had before
        him and in many ways for all time
        [Music]
        oh
        [Music]
        at Ing we believe in the power of
        innovation what it can mean to people we
        want to bring this Innovative Spirit to
        our sponsorship of Dutch art and culture
        we knew that for this challenge we need
        to team up with experts from various
        fields to make this come to life we're
        using a lot of data to improve business
        life but we haven't been using data that
        much in a way that touches the human
        soul you could say that we use
        technology and data like Rembrandt used
        is paints and his brushes to create
        something new
        thank you
        the first step was to study the works of
        Rembrandt in order to create an
        extensive database
        We Gather the data from his collection
        of paintings from many different sources
        including 3D scans and upscale images
        using a deep learning algorithm
        because a significant percentage of
        Rembrandt paintings were portraits we
        analyzed the demography of the faces in
        these paintings looking at factors like
        gender age and head Direction the data
        led us to the conclusion that the survey
        should be a portrait of a Caucasian male
        with facial hair between 30 and 40 years
        old in dark clothing with a collar
        wearing a hat and facing to the right
        from there we started to extract
        features only with faces that were
        related to that specific profile
        and we had to create a whole painting
        from just data and we used a statistical
        analysis and various algorithms to
        extract the features that make Rembrandt
        Rembrandt
        we took parts of the face and we started
        to compare them and then based on this
        we're able to create a typical Rembrandt
        eye or nose or mouth or ear
        after generating the features we were
        focusing on the face proportions we used
        an algorithm that can detect over 60
        points in a painting we were able to
        align the faces and to estimate the
        distance between the eyes the nose and
        the mouth and the ears
        [Music]
        and painting is not a 2d picture it's 3D
        you can see the calf as you can see the
        process and that's what makes the
        painting come alive a hive map is
        essential to make the painting a
        painting
        we incorporated the height map into the
        painting and printed on a 3D printer
        that uses a special paint-based UV ink
        it printed many layers one on top of the
        other
        which resulted in the height and texture
        of the final painting
        [Music]
        sometimes a magical moment to see a
        painting for the first time even if it's
        computer generated for me it is
        something special I would have believed
        if I was sold at a museum that it would
        have been a real Rembrandt just one I
        haven't seen before
        [Music]
        what happens inside of organizations
        when you want to do data analytics now
        it's being applied to the world of Art
        and we'll go a bit deeper this was about
        six seven years ago it was a project
        funded by Microsoft happened out of Tu
        delft in the Netherlands those three
        guys were the main Engineers behind it
        they have no art training they just took
        the images and then created this thing
        when I encountered this image it really
        haunted me but then I was at a I was
        giving a seminar a talk in Australia and
        I showed this image and asked the
        question at the time said like
        who is this who's the painter behind
        this portrait and a Gentleman raised
        their hand and said oh that's a rem
        Ranch all right oh how do you know it's
        a Rembrandt well you know it's got the
        style this Direction all the things they
        said I've never seen this before he said
        but uh but experiment sir but how do you
        how are you so convinced well because I
        did my PhD
        on REM Ranch I'm the I'm the I'm the
        curator of the Australian Portrait
        Gallery so like okay so he has some
        sweet cried
        um and and then he was done as well when
        he saw the videos like oh my god
        um and so the reaction in the world was
        you know this one AI just 3D printed a
        brand new Rembrandt is shockingly good
        and then my favorite reaction is the
        digital run brand a new way to mock art
        made by fools
        [Music]
        okay now this this
        reaction is the reaction that's going to
        happen in all your organizations
        right both your employees your managers
        your c-suite your board especially
        okay right and then also your customers
        right this is the thing to expect as
        more and more AI gets deployed inside of
        our organizations and as new
        organizations come up that are AI native
        in many ways
        okay and so let's just think about this
        in terms of how do we contextualize this
        AI era okay there's been about four
        waves of AI between the first and second
        uh waves there have been these AI
        Winters there was an era of cybernetics
        okay then trained experts export systems
        some of you may remember uh then what
        started in 2000s out of Google Facebook
        Amazon and so forth good Learners lots
        of data available breakthroughs in
        computation Breakers and algorithms and
        we started to use machine learning
        without knowing it so when you use
        Netflix we're using machine learning
        when you were using Waze you're using
        machine learning when you were using
        Amazon you were using machine learning
        but it was in the plumbing in the
        plumbing right 20 years of that amazing
        amazing progress that was the system
        that basically built the next rembrand
        and today we're in this generative
        systems wave now okay generative systems
        and we'll talk more about that and what
        these do is that they this this happened
        again this this ongoing trend of lots of
        data amazing compute Nvidia why didn't I
        buy the stock before Nvidia right uh
        through the roof because they're they're
        the ones that are now becoming a sole
        supplier of gpus and so forth and then
        of course AI algorithmic advances as
        well all these things converge and then
        the the interesting thing is that the
        application space is jumping across the
        board
        so the the same technologies that have
        sort of enabled these image diffusion
        models right uh are also helping us find
        better proteins
        it's exactly the same technology right
        so this is my colleague um Armin
        mcreutchen a foxy pioneering uh I spend
        a bunch of time with them thinking about
        AI Force companies and life sciences and
        this is like you know he upload His
        Image and got all these nice avatars
        come through but the same the same
        technology the same technology enables
        brand new protein Creations that have
        never existed before right reinforcement
        learning and the core technology right
        alphago amazing amazing right helps us
        really understand what's going on within
        the context of of exploring the chemical
        landscape again type of matter for a
        farmer company and then similarly large
        language models which we'll be talking
        about again you can read the entire
        literature figure out different
        different ways to go after things okay
        so this ability to take cute solutions
        to avatars playing go right right
        creating your recipe can now be applied
        to serious problems as well okay and
        that's the leap that has been not
        anticipated by most of us okay and then
        our generation today so um who's who's
        been on mid-journey anybody been on
        mid-journey raise your hands a few of
        you so let's go and I would just want to
        go this is like risky right like I'm
        gonna do a live demo uh so so let's see
        what happens okay so first I'm gonna I'm
        gonna use this service called po uh
        which has a um mid-journey uh bot so I'm
        gonna let's see
        um uh a
        portrait
        in the style of Rembrandt right let's do
        that
        right uh featuring misspelled
        okay
        featuring
        a Harvard Business
        School alum at their
        let's do 15th reunion
        at their 15th reunion
        yeah you know
        classic
        Rembrandt
        uh see I can't even spell Rembrandt
        Style
        uh and then um trying to lick hip
        why not
        okay
        please work
        waiting oh my God okay all right great
        so we got this okay I got this uh this
        prompt I'm going to take this prompt
        properly
        and I'm gonna oh let's make sure I get
        it properly there we go and I'm going to
        copy it
        okay then I'm gonna go into my
        mid-journey bot
        because I'm not good at prompts yet
        okay
        and I'm going to put this prompt in
        okay
        and we're gonna start this prompt
        okay so it's going to do a little thing
        we're going to wait you know a few
        seconds I have some patience
        uh let's talk about the coffee here
        I'm still surprised that we don't serve
        Dunkin Donuts on campus it's just like
        so I was doing some stuff here you can
        see uh you'll see it come through
        um
        and um
        see
        okay you can see the images being
        created in front of your eyes so what
        you saw before right
        several months of effort with lots of
        people I'm going to try to sort of
        create something very fast in front of
        your eyes uh as it happens so 46 percent
        uh now look it's already biased it's
        showing dudes
        and white dude said that
        you know uh you know so so we got to fix
        it now of course that could be prom I
        could have said Multicultural you know
        so on and so forth and it will respond
        to that but its Baseline is to be is to
        be biased uh all right uh and uh uh so
        it when it when it thinks about you guys
        you know it sort of imagines you in uh
        or did I lose it where'd it go there we
        go uh it imagines you guys in um
        in you know this is
        this is you
        so by the way this is this is what the
        the world and the honest things about uh
        HBS MBA graduates
        and I kind of not too hipster either
        like I asked him to be hipster and you
        know I don't know uh but but but you
        know you
        mean like the like Twisted a bit looking
        at you I should have asked you to be
        wearing a hat and so forth but right
        seconds
        right six years ago months of effort
        loss of activity now boom done and you
        know if you sort of look if you look
        around what's what's fascinating is I
        mean this just the Discord is amazing to
        see right so you can see all the
        different things people create right
        uh ultra realistic well let me just make
        it bigger so you guys can see some of
        these images here
        uh it's just fascinating
        the stuff that gets done and all of this
        is computer generated in the moment
        right somebody's doing still life look
        at that
        that's pretty stunning
        right in the same era
        right
        okay so uh and again this same
        technology we can do the proteins
        same technology
        okay applied over
        is this good like it's not so quiet
        are you stoned
        yeah yeah
        no all your kids are already on this
        so you guys better get your kids to help
        you uh right because they're already
        like far down they're doing their
        homework on this thing we'll see blah
        blah right it's like that that thing's
        already gone okay so so so let me get
        back to my presentation so just to you
        know to take the stunningness away and
        get back to more boring stuff okay so um
        so again
        this this is the exponential age right
        this is the exponential age that we're
        talking about that in six years time you
        get this kind of photorealistic stuff
        coming out at scale available for free
        almost I pay 20 bucks a month for my
        journey access
        um so let's let's put this back into
        context there's a ton of hype around AI
        a ton of hypernia and so I'm going to
        provide you with an economic framework
        to understand why this is the case Okay
        from an economic perspective two things
        are happening simultaneously the first
        thing is that people are reimagining
        every single problem as an AI problem
        driving Dentistry surgery medicine you
        name it everything is an AI problem
        right so we're recasting everything as
        an AI problem and that's important to
        understand that that the world's
        imagination saying how could I apply AI
        or how could I apply AI here how can I
        recast this problem and just to give
        this put this in context uh you know
        essentially ago electricity was the AI
        right and we were thinking about how do
        you apply electricity a whole bunch of
        things and so like if you if you sort of
        uh especially in Asia right there's all
        these great sliding doors everywhere all
        the doors are automatic you just walk in
        it's like feels like the future here we
        still have some crank handles at our
        doors and so forth we still want the
        tradition of like heavy doors are
        important for us
        um you know it matters so so so but what
        what happened like uh people decided
        that opening doors is not a mechanical
        human effort problem it's an electrical
        problem right and then everything is uh
        is cast that way and we solved it
        through electricity and the funny thing
        that happened to me was uh you know my
        mom lives in Toronto she uh she's uh you
        know she's got a 20 year old Camry right
        that she drives once in a while I'm
        trying to get her to use Uber more but
        she still likes to drive so my daughter
        who's 19 now right we were up there five
        years ago uh and we went for a drive and
        it was hot in Toronto and she's like try
        to find the button
        to get the windows to come down and I'm
        like honey
        you got a crank
        yeah Craig it's like what right because
        for her she's like everything is
        electric like you know the car car
        windows are electric how could it be
        that you have a mechanical solution
        because we thought of the problem in
        that way so first thing everything's
        being recast as an AI problem second
        thing is the cost to Innovative AI has
        dropped like a rock
        continues to drop so when you have these
        two things happening simultaneously cost
        to innovate Innovation with AI has
        dropped substantially and everything is
        being recast you have this big economic
        boom and lots of hype lots of startups
        lots of companies established companies
        trying to make sense of this okay
        um and so
        so what it was what do you mean by
        definitions what do we mean actually by
        AI right two definitions out in the
        literature the left one is about science
        fiction right
        so far
        right which is autonomous things beings
        doing their own thing and the right
        definition which is not a strong AI
        the right definition is all about
        and actually computers are able to
        perform that humans once performed
        that's it
        super simple helps us figure this out
        okay most of the action in the last 20
        years and now is still in the weak AI
        side right algorithms being applied at
        scale statistics at scale I think about
        it as that
        um and so uh this book that I wrote with
        Marco basically said look we can't just
        be about technology right even though
        I'm the technology and operations
        Management Group it's really about it's
        application in business right so I tell
        the dean you know when one of our August
        Alum Stephen Schwartzman gave a ton of
        money to MIT
        right to set up the College of computing
        there were like lots of long faces
        you're like oh my God you know how could
        it be
        I said it's the best news ever for HBS
        maybe not so much for Harvard for HBS
        though because all of a sudden MIT is
        going to take care of the technical
        labor they're going to create all the
        boffins we want that understand this
        stuff right and all we need to do here
        at HBS is to get our students and our
        alums comfortable with what's going on
        and think about its application and make
        a ton of money and have a good impact to
        it
        I was like it was super clear like come
        on the labor and this only a mile away
        if you'd only break out of our bubble
        right it's only a mile away Uber is
        faster right it's great right and so so
        so that's the thing and our whole
        perspective in the book is let's think
        about this from a business perspective
        from a business perspective you want to
        think about the architecture of the
        business and there's a business model
        value creation and value capture and
        then operating model right how you
        deliver the value to your business and
        we hear everything about scale how you
        serve many customers scope what you
        offer them and then learning how you
        improve right that's what a business is
        all about and we see a systematic
        application of AI and digital Platforms
        in in companies so a great example
        another example from China uh uh this
        company JD digits uh was asked by the
        Chinese government to uh to create
        services and offerings in the
        agriculture space they looked around it
        said oh 700 million pigs are being
        raised in China we can maybe offer
        Insurance very quickly they realize that
        the cost to just count every single page
        would be astronomical in terms of people
        right 700 million pigs and then how
        about you know that which pick has been
        insured properly
        right are you going to do genetic
        testing are you it's crazy so they said
        ah facial recognition so you see this
        thing on the on the bottom right right
        they took off the shelf facial
        recognition software from your iPhone
        and said oh can we apply it to pigs and
        guess what it works
        right pigs and also I've just learned
        chickens can be uniquely identified
        through facial recognition
        a little bit of training it can be done
        so oh once we go solve this problem we
        can put cameras all over the the the
        farm we can keep track of what they're
        eating we can keep track of their health
        we can keep track of when they're ready
        for bacon right all that stuff
        all that stuff can be done and now it's
        a different type of company right again
        you're recasting the problem as an AI
        problem it allows you to think of a
        company in a very different way it's not
        a traditional life insurance company for
        pigs right it's it's really our health
        insurance company for face it's like an
        AI powered company that's camera flying
        all the Farms right collecting all this
        data then building a platform right
        because you can attach veterinarians
        feed companies abattoirs all that kind
        of stuff on the platform right
        reimagining this thing so they actually
        launched two things they did one for
        pigs and then I met this lady from the
        who built the system uh at an executive
        uh actually a few months ago and she
        said oh yeah we also the chickens like I
        said the chicken photos too if you want
        like yeah all right so this is one
        example we've got recasting problems
        there's AI problems reimagining business
        so second one this comes from my lab
        we published this paper in this okay
        Journal called Jam oncology
        and what we did is we we crowdsourced a
        way to do radiation therapy treatment
        planning we spent eight weeks 50 Grand
        okay and our solution was as good but
        actually better than all the commercial
        software but as good as the average
        Hardware training radiationcologist
        okay as good okay uh
        importantly like I'm uh not importantly
        side note
        footnote I'm the second author on the
        second last author on this paper which
        gives me some Prestige or something and
        um the the and if the kids can just
        close their their ears I got a C in
        biology in 10th Grade
        I got a C in biology in 10th Grade it
        was terrible I said never again I'm
        going to touch biology I did chemistry
        in in uh and first year undergrad of
        engineering it was terrible at chemistry
        as well okay this this biology chemistry
        not my thing I'm just gonna do
        electrical engineering and computer
        stuff right and here I am never touch
        biology since that time a co-author on
        this paper in the leading cancer journal
        in the world right uh talking about AI
        applications for radiation therapy
        planning okay
        the cost to innovate with AI have
        dropped right we recast problems we also
        cost in weight has dropped okay so
        that's the trend we're looking at okay
        so now let's put this into context one
        of my favorite firms uh uh comes out of
        again under China they've done the most
        in many ways in terms of really
        reimagining of what a capitalist company
        can do many of you might have heard of
        this company called Ant group and
        financial uh right uh this is the the
        perfect you know exponential growth you
        want to see in a company if I flat for a
        while and then boom grows up lots of
        products and services uh 1.2 billion
        users
        okay 1.2 billion users now here's your
        first audience interactive Point imagine
        your company was serving 1.2 billion
        users
        how many
        custom how many employees would you need
        in your organization
        how many organizations how many people
        would you need a new organization and
        this current structure to serve 1.2
        billion users
        Okay who wants to be the first victim
        oh Graham
        Graham you'll call them
        several hundred thousand yeah okay great
        others
        1.2 billion uh users
        anybody else
        anybody else who's Brave
        nobody's Brave
        5 million
        five million great
        yeah so These Guys these guys have 10
        000 employees
        10 000 employees
        right it's a different company than what
        we're used to thinking about okay you
        have to have ai and algorithms and data
        at the core to do that one amazing
        metric they have is three one zero okay
        three minutes to apply for something one
        minute for approval zero human
        intervention
        three one zero at a scale of 1.2 billion
        users three one zero I've been you know
        here in the US since 1997 I moved from
        Canada I've had the same bank you know
        got it at MIT uh you know in Central
        Square they've gone through many
        transitions right they keep asking me
        every time they transition like we need
        you to come in and do a signature card
        sir
        I'm like okay uh uh they're also three
        one zero but it's like three months to
        apply for something
        one month for approval and zero
        automation
        many of you guys probably work in that
        bank I'm I'm not naming names right very
        different Beast okay so
        um so again again we want to start
        thinking about this like okay how
        imagine what they're doing in their
        business model and operating model the
        first thing to note is that their app is
        super weird everything happens on the
        app but it's super weird right because
        it not only do they do banking but they
        also do like gasoline and Mobile Top-Up
        and tracking your packages and ordering
        the thing you're like what why what's
        the ROI on tracking packages in a
        banking app
        so when we ask them that question they
        go look no you don't understand we're
        not a bank we're not even a fintech
        we're a fin life company we want to be
        wherever people spend money and we want
        that data
        right so we're in the flow of money
        business not in the stock of money
        business and our power is to be able to
        imagine all the use cases that the money
        is being used at and make it available
        on our app and then that data allows us
        to basically then be be so good okay so
        so the whole model is such that they're
        thinking a lot about about the business
        value creation that they're doing for
        their customers and on this Dimension
        what we see is that there's three
        vectors now right when you guys were on
        campus we talked mostly about the left
        side product value
        okay how good is a product how well does
        it work the fin finish the functionality
        right but what also matters now is the
        network value the ecosystem value right
        Network effects but also the data value
        so these two Dimensions have become
        super critical and that's how and thinks
        about the world right their value
        creation is about product network data
        that's what that's what matters
        okay and so then when we think about the
        operating model which is near and dear
        to my heart because of course the
        strategy guys can talk strategy all they
        want but if you can't deliver value good
        luck right if you want to think about
        scale scope and learning and at ant it's
        a very different architecture
        of of their of their of their data very
        different architecture uh of their of
        their Enterprise right different set of
        capabilities different side of
        Technology assets and these these
        differences are are Salient and I'll
        show you some data about why that
        matters okay
        um
        and you know most of us are living on
        the left hand side
        at and right the idea is that you
        basically remove human bottlenecks and
        you substitute with machines
        okay an AI right and this code from
        satinadella predates all the Gen AI
        stuff he's been doing now is really
        about AI is the near runtime that's just
        going to shape all that we do okay and
        the idea is if you if you substitute
        technology and processes driven by
        technology instead of by people then
        you're approaching zero marginal costs
        right just think about you know when you
        search on Google and there's an auction
        there's no humans doing the auctions
        when you are getting a recommendation
        for your Spotify playlist there's no
        humans giving you that right that allows
        them to go scale in this way humans are
        around designing the systems but not at
        the core of doing the work right and the
        logic here basically is the the more
        data you get the better algorithms you
        build the better algorithms you build
        the better service you have the better
        service you have the more usage and so
        on and so forth that's the flywheel you
        want to be in and that's what these
        companies do really well especially ant
        but the core part though of ant is what
        we call an AI Factory okay the AI
        Factory is what systematizes
        analysis and prediction at scale okay
        most organizations have lots of
        investments in Ai and analytics and so
        on and so forth but they're mostly
        craft-based organizations right they're
        organized as Craftsmen delicate models
        you want data okay meeting meeting
        meeting meeting meeting meeting meeting
        meeting meeting meeting meeting
        to get access to the data in the company
        oh let's get the lawyers in because we
        don't know
        right what happens even here right
        meeting meeting for data right so you
        you've hired this high-powered MIT
        Harvard Caltech Stanford phds and Ai and
        all they're doing is spending time is on
        meetings and on slack right and on
        phones and more meetings I'm trying to
        negotiate access to data okay
        these guys industrialize the data
        process at ant there's only 500 AI
        engineers
        the rest is all data engineering
        okay
        right and so what I see often see in
        companies that want to do AI they
        basically focus on algorithms but not on
        data
        right it should be flipped around right
        the the optimal ratio is five data
        Engineers to one AI engineer
        typically the other way around one data
        engineer to five AI people right and
        it's not going to work it's not going to
        scale now what does an AI Factory do if
        you start thinking about industrializing
        the process the App Factory does three
        PS okay predictions pattern recognition
        process automation that's what the AI
        Factory does it does it at scale imagine
        your company as a set of predictions
        imagine your company the set of pattern
        recognition activities right
        consumer Trends fraud or not so on and
        so forth predicting price increases
        predicting consumer churn right and then
        also processes right and these things
        are industrialized inside the operating
        core of a company right that's what ant
        has shown but that's what all the major
        tech companies have been able to pull
        off
        and so in in traditional operating
        models we sort of see the same concerns
        of scale scope and learning and we've
        learned from many of these organizations
        how to do this right and the solution
        that was invented in the last century
        was to basically build a divisional
        system right be focused get the thing
        done
        right the division System created a ton
        of value right our modern built economy
        has been based on the divisional system
        but the problem is that it doesn't scale
        too well when the demands on the number
        of users you want and the demands on the
        scope you want when the demands on
        learning increase right you basically
        have this concave curve that shows up
        right it Peters out right and you you
        live this right complexity of the
        organization operation complexity
        administrative costs just inertia
        um when we think about companies that
        are digital first AI first they have
        near zero marginal costs and they put
        into play Network and learning effects
        right what we talked about before right
        so think about this as a network effect
        the value of their partner service
        increases as more and more users use it
        right but then what AI does is that it
        supercharges this curve and makes it way
        more sharper
        that's why we're sort of seeing these
        crazy valuations that's why we're seeing
        this crazy scaling come through
        and so so then the the you remove the
        traditional constraints scale that's
        about zero marginal costs and network
        effects scope is about modularity across
        markets right and learning is constant
        through ML and AI
        and this leads to Collision this leads
        to collision between two distinctive
        models right the one that can scale
        exponentially and the one that has a
        convex City uh concavity in this way all
        right and by the way this picture is
        also the picture of Our Lives from 2020
        to 2022 and a half or something right an
        exponential disease process called covid
        exponential right that's why we had to
        do social distancing so that we wouldn't
        infect each other okay with fixed
        Hospital capacity so the whole world
        learned about the dangers of AI of not
        AI systems the danger of exponential
        systems is just that this has been
        happening over and over again in a range
        of Industries as well
        right and so what we see is the that you
        know my dear colleague uh talked a lot
        about disruption and that's still going
        on but we also talk about Collision you
        have Collision of business models and
        operating models right and you basically
        have a concave system with the convex
        system colliding and then once once a
        system achieves exponential growth stage
        it's really hard for us to pull that
        back now lots of failure right and what
        happens is that if you're on the blue
        line you're sitting there and you're
        going why would I invest in the digital
        business
        low value low value low value low value
        until the Collision happens right you've
        seen this picture before over and over
        again
        and so that's the that's the story of
        collision that we see in the age of AI
        and of course the AI Force companies
        like moderna you know Stefan Bensel
        alone from her school you know as the
        CEO basically was able to to launch the
        drug right in weeks
        in weeks the actual time to design the
        coveted vaccine was four hours
        the rest was just testing and safety and
        critical four hours
        right because they thought about mRNA as
        digital instructions for the body
        okay now this is where the kids will
        come in
        she in I want to say it yes
        all right so my my daughter introduced
        me to this and I'm like stunned uh and
        uh does anybody want to does a does a
        child of uh your kid you want to explain
        to she
        yeah let's get him to these guys don't
        have a clue you have to
        you you know what she oh I'm sorry
        drop drop some signs on them like just
        tell them a little bit like what is it
        yeah she's uh like read not you your son
        okay okay you can translate for him yeah
        so she's a AI generated design company
        which also connects with the influencers
        in the audience as The Social Network
        yes so it's a fast fashion company get
        the app and try it it's crazy here's
        what it does
        okay
        one to two million new clothing designs
        per year
        translates to 4 000 new skus per day
        4 000 new skus per day get launched
        okay the traditional fast fashion Uniqlo
        h m Zara right twenty thousand forty
        thousand skus
        right order of magnitude subordinary
        difference okay time from designer
        product three to five days right 14 to
        60 days minimum over size less than 100
        versus about 10 000 and up
        very different economics
        okay it's a two-sided platform is reset
        right you on the one hand you accumulate
        customers you create a very social
        environment digital marketing Trend
        based loss of engagement on the platform
        okay but then the other side are six
        thousand small and medium-sized
        manufacturers in China that can make
        stuff to spec
        okay so their ability to say let's go
        get a shirt designed right using AI for
        design the shirt get the shirt designed
        and manufactured put it on the products
        respect see if there's a signal if
        people care about it people care about
        it
        let's go make some more
        okay and that's the that's the magic
        I've done it done at that scale right
        now big controversy about them
        environmental footprint is it all junk
        blah blah blah I'm not gonna you know it
        matters we'll talk about ethics later
        but I just want to show you the art of
        the possible Right are the possible and
        the thing to note is right for 20 years
        we we said oh the Google lessons the
        Facebook lessons don't apply to us we're
        so so special we're dealing in the world
        of adults
        they are all in the world of digital
        well guess what right moderna showed us
        what to do with biomedicine
        same processes same investments in
        digital and AI right and then qian has
        joined us to do this in fast fashion
        okay and they've basically said would
        take away silos we create a software
        stack for our manufacturers we have a
        software stack for our customer side and
        then that's how we go to business
        this is again William Gibson this is
        living in the future now
        right I was talking to somebody who's
        high up in Alibaba and they were you
        know they're in Europe and so forth and
        the European Regulators are saying like
        which European companies uh are you
        worried about and he goes
        I'm not worried about any European
        company
        I don't care about Xi'an and timu and
        those guys European companies they can't
        match our scale
        right and so there's like almost this
        divide showing up right there's the rest
        of us that are sort of still puddling
        wrong in the ways we've always worked
        and then these types of companies
        emerging doing crazy things
        okay
        of course AI Sports companies are facing
        backlash
        right lots of problems my favorite is
        what happened with Zillow they forgot
        economics and adverse election their
        algorithms running well so they're not
        they're not without fault okay uh
        um and then of course uh you know all of
        us and incumbent companies also face
        lots of problems
        okay problems Galore
        and
        um probably the hardest chapter we wrote
        in our book was this chapter around the
        ethics of digital scale scope and
        learning because we thought we're
        business school professors like ethics
        and and so forth there's a different
        department right uh or you go across the
        river to talk to philosophers no but
        what we realized is that no no no this
        is like this is now becoming a core core
        part of the if you imagine what we
        showed you in terms of exponential
        scaling of all the benefits we can also
        exponentially scale the harm very
        quickly very quickly right so then the
        responsibility to think about ethics is
        upfront in the design of the business
        and the design of the systems not after
        the fact with the ogc right if the
        general counselor gets involved it's too
        late right and I want to harken back to
        Toyota production system guys right yeah
        TPS remember no quality Department in
        TPS quality was built in ethics have to
        be built into your processes today you
        need to understand how algorithms will
        go wrong you need to understand the
        needs for transparency the needs the
        bias can creep in like the bias we saw
        and the dudes being showed in the HBS
        side of things okay and so that's a
        that's the world that we have
        um and of course even ant group right
        God uh got declawed because uh you know
        Jack Mao who's now hiding I think
        somewhere in Japan uh you know pissed
        off Xi Jinping uh and told him that The
        Regulators were stupid
        right two weeks before the biggest IPO
        in the history of IPOs right and the
        state said we'll show you who dad is you
        know
        um and made that work so so
        um so many of us are leading these
        transformation Journeys inside our
        organization but we know it's not easy
        right it's not easy
        um
        uh transformation has many definitions
        most of them sort of are are focused on
        what I sort of see as dramatic change in
        formal appearance my preference is to
        actually move away from that definition
        and my clicker just oh there we go uh
        there's a biological one that forces
        biology I don't know okay let's move on
        physics physics a nuclear process I like
        the mathematics definition right a
        process by which one figure expression
        or function is converted into another
        equivalent some important respect but is
        definitely expressed or represented
        transformation is about keeping your
        core your mission your values your
        process your your perspectives on
        customer value but then doing it in a
        very different way
        okay and so if you believe this we see
        lots of companies are are investing and
        trying to do digital transformation even
        you saw our Dean is going crazy about it
        uh I'm really happy uh that he's doing
        it uh and uh and there's some important
        lessons here this is work that Marco my
        colleague did uh with Microsoft we did a
        study of large uh public companies uh uh
        and did a big interview study uh and
        Survey of what they were doing in
        digital transformation here's what we
        saw here's what Marco saw the two
        factors
        are causally related to returns between
        the ones that are doing really good
        which is doing really bad the technical
        architecture and the processes that
        enable them
        okay those are the two factors that
        basically Drive the difference between
        winners and losers uh in in the ones
        that invest in digital transformation
        and make it work and we've done all the
        econometric tricks to be able to look at
        that as a causal error okay and what it
        looks like is when we did the analysis
        the laggers look like this they're
        behind in terms of returns compared to
        the leaders and also the total
        Enterprise Value growth their systems
        look like this
        are these familiar to you
        yeah
        okay so this is the work but by the way
        this is not just a a an architecture
        diagram of the system this is also the
        organizational diagram as well
        right and all of these intersections are
        all the meetings that keep happening
        over and over again
        there's lots of entropy here
        okay and the leaders look like this
        right and what's nice about this data is
        that we're not actually even sampling on
        on the crazy for Tech firms we're
        looking at existing firms that are
        driving the transformation so we see
        return value and we see a causal
        relationship between changing your
        architecture your technological
        architecture and your organization
        architecture and your processes and the
        the ratio I feel is like 30 70. 30 of
        the work is heavy lifting in technology
        70 is all unfortunately lead
        right it's all OB it's all change
        management and Process Management 70
        percent
        again as a Tom Professor I'm sad right I
        just I've got you the most brilliant
        thing fix it but no no like apparently
        people matter and we gotta we gotta we
        gotta we gotta get the people behind
        this I don't understand uh uh but anyway
        so so you know so this is these are some
        interesting uh data for us
        but here's the thing I want to sort of
        show you to really bring this point home
        these are two images of cities you know
        you spend a bunch of time here in Boston
        when you went to downtown you were
        always lost even with GPS right and that
        is Manhattan right uh and uh the the the
        graphs at the at the right of the of the
        maps are actually a scientific measure
        of entropy of the street
        so you know this is why Academia is so
        cool some nerd somewhere decided to go
        up and measure entropy of streets right
        and then wrote a paper about it and I'm
        using that paper right now okay so what
        happened so as you know these are all
        cow Pats right Boston cow Pats and what
        happened was asphalt got invented and we
        just poured asphalt down our cow pass
        okay that's what we did Manhattan uh
        Philadelphia Paris said no no new
        technology asphalt cars are coming right
        we're going to create a grid system
        create a great system okay and you can
        see the difference in entropy
        here's its story guys in most
        organizations our processes look like
        Boston and then what we're doing is
        we're pouring digital and AI concrete
        all over them
        that's what we're doing
        right we don't change our processes
        right we just Oh no just just throw it
        and then people go I was in a in a
        Pharma r d meeting a few a few weeks ago
        they're like yeah we keep investing in
        technology and it doesn't pay off
        I go yeah
        you were in Boston
        you're not changing like you're not
        actually having the guts to change your
        processes
        right how you get work done is very
        different with technology than when it's
        not and so that's the world that you
        need to be thinking about change the
        processes
        as much as uh as you invest in the
        technology
        okay
        GPD let's let's let's bring this home
        okay
        so you know
        stand up we've been sitting for a while
        stand up if you use chat GPT
        at least once
        okay okay sit down okay now now now now
        now now
        stand up uh if you think that Chad GPT
        is going to change your function your
        job your your industry
        thank you
        okay
        all right yeah
        okay one more
        one more one more stand up if you have
        no clue how this thing works
        be honest otherwise I'm cold calling you
        guys I'm cold calling you guys
        all right all right all right all right
        all right so
        um
        my sense of what's happening with that
        GPT and we'll put this in is that what
        happens when the cost and price of
        knowledge work drops and quality also
        increases I showed you with the Ram
        brand thing one one example right but
        again we can apply economics to this and
        so I asked mid-journey to create images
        of the HBS campus uh 100 years from now
        making it look futuristic
        came up with some good interesting ideas
        but let's let's flip it let's actually
        apply it specifically and again we're
        going to do some demos it's always worth
        something I'm going to do demos uh we're
        gonna do some demos about how this would
        impact us okay
        so um
        so I uh wrote this case on moderna
        uh uh you know just as the vaccine was
        coming out
        so I what I've done is I have uploaded
        the case onto Chan GPT
        it's probably illegal but
        I don't know okay so uh it's uploaded
        and then I just my first prompt is can
        you please summarize this case
        for us
        okay let's see if it works
        hopefully it hasn't timed out
        all right all right uh all right okay so
        so now imagine imagine you're back at
        HBS and now you have the superpower
        I know by the time you guys were in EC
        ASE reading was you know marginal at
        best
        so anyway so so so so so okay if I'm a
        student I go Okay cool so
        um I'm uh an MBA student
        at a student
        it's Harvard
        I have a background
        in computer science
        please
        help
        me come up with five comments I could
        make in the class
        to make me look
        super smart
        with the professor
        and raise my profile
        with my fellow students
        let's see what it does
        do you see why we're having an oh crap
        moment right now
        this thing knows our case method like we
        haven't trained the lowercase method it
        knows our case method all right let's go
        let's go further a bit
        um uh let's let's do the finance bro uh
        uh uh
        I'm just gonna take the same prompt
        if I can
        okay
        and
        background in
        vestment Banking and private equity
        okay
        uh
        helped me
        I I have not had time to read the case
        so please
        um come up
        with comments that will provoke
        debate
        it's always I I value comments from
        students that provoke debate oh yeah
        it's good lots of good things all right
        absolutely so nice
        so nice it's like oh wow uh all right
        um let's do this um
        the decision
        I read the first paragraph right the
        decision in the case is to uh is to if
        is if to is I can't rewrite that in the
        case is to is to spin out
        the vaccine business
        can you give me
        three
        two by twos
        Frameworks
        to help me
        make the decision
        also please explain
        the axes
        and why they matter
        okay let's see what it does
        okay this is the case I wrote
        okay great uh can you populate
        oh I always say please it's always nice
        it's always good to be nice to your AI
        you know I don't know whether they
        become strong and they have your memory
        of your interactions
        so be nice be nice to your AI uh
        can you please please
        um oh can you please
        um uh
        uh populate
        the two by twos
        uh with the
        choices
        in the case
        and justify
        is positioning
        pretty darn good right
        okay so here's my question to you while
        this is doing
        uh oh and then I can also use this to
        create new cases
        super easy I can point into a watching
        an article
        take two hours and have awesome case
        done with just a just a just the article
        and so forth here's my question to you
        should we allow students access to the
        superpower
        okay although against please raise your
        hand
        one two so sir can you can you explain
        why
        yeah
        no so you're saying no are you saying no
        or yes oh no I say yes oh no I want the
        people to say no people that said no
        that gentleman back there
        right here
        oh no with the tie
        well the student will not really
        uh get much out of the case he will just
        go into class and
        do whatever Chet said yeah and he will
        not learn yeah just how to it's a real
        risk right like that they would just
        basically if I was a lazy student
        throughout my career even as a PhD
        student
        wow nobody has to think about the case
        and think put it get his own ideas about
        it yeah others that are sort of like
        really worried about this being used
        there's a little bit of age bias here so
        I'm a bit worried but uh well uh you
        guys look very young so it's okay uh
        55 years ago our study group was the
        equivalent of this product so we spent
        an hour and a half every night talking
        about the three cases for the next day
        yes I got information from five other
        guys yes um they're all guys at that
        time too they well there were two there
        were two women in our class one of whom
        I think is here so oh great okay
        um but at any rate the same price now
        the five other guys probably weren't as
        smart as this thing yeah but uh those
        who want to stand in your room and
        certainly help prepare me for the case
        so I don't see any harm anymore okay
        I've been doing this okay all right all
        right uh there's a hand back there the
        the lady over there
        so I'm going to take the classic HBS
        hybrid answer which is
        okay so here's a full answer but I think
        it's two parts which is at the start I
        think it fundamentally goes against the
        ethos of curiosity and learning and
        actually voicing your opinion and
        potentially being wrong but provoking
        that debate where I think this actually
        could be helpful
        is after you have the class and you can
        say oh what does the bot actually think
        and I think in the long run why it's
        dangerous is because you can come down
        to an intellectual conformity
        right like these are all very smart
        answers but if everyone has the same
        answer then where's the Ingenuity and
        the whole ethos of the case study method
        to try to tease out those extraneous
        thoughts that can provoke really
        interesting conversation
        yeah
        so so what should we do sorry just keep
        the mic I've got a question for you what
        should we do like should we ban this
        like just like tell the students well
        that's why I was taking the classic
        Bridge Approach which was I think you
        should think students would really say
        yeah Grandpa sure like no okay of course
        not they're actually yeah you guys are
        screwed thank God I'm old but but I
        think where it's helpful genuinely is ex
        post facto perhaps in the last portion
        of class and then you can say okay if
        like if you take the kind of not that
        HBS students would abide to this but
        like a pseudo Business
        Schools aren't going to do this then
        we're screwed right
        between those that have the technology
        and know how to use it versus those that
        do no I don't I think every it's pretty
        easy to use yes right so I think so
        should we have a prompt engineering
        class at the beginning of MBA here's how
        to ask questions of chai GPT
        oh God
        but do you see do you see the problem
        we're in do you see the problem we're in
        this is this is like an existential
        question to us now right and we're
        working like mad to try to figure out
        how to how to answer this there's a hand
        but you see like it's like
        I woke up and I'm like we are
        yeah uh bleeped right so I'm interested
        in this notion of hallucinations and
        um just when the technology makes stuff
        up yes because I also think that that
        would be interesting to come to class
        not having read the case and talking
        about things that are yeah good for me I
        can give the threes it's awesome I also
        I get threes right I have to give threes
        yeah no I think I think there's a
        there's a there's look this is this is
        the crisis we're in there is a crisis I
        I sort of I'm a bit of an alarmist about
        this like this is like a covet level
        crisis
        if you think about it fundamentally this
        is by the way your kids are already
        using it to answer their homework
        questions right so so that that ship has
        already sailed and so let's ask Chad GPD
        should you use chat GPT
        um for their case
        preparation
        [Music]
        home work please
        provide
        pros and cons
        and rank your answers
        why not
        okay
        can you evaluate the above
        from the perspective
        of current MBA students
        you get the point right so again this is
        this is something that we're actually
        right now trying to figure out what to
        do and stay tuned
        uh uh I I am also very excited to find
        out okay so so so let's let's let me put
        this into a broader context uh I lost
        the video
        okay perfect all right so so here's what
        it means
        um imagine a skills distribution that's
        normally distributed right right side is
        the is the people that are super smart
        we think that all of us are on the right
        tail right and then the there's a left
        tail the question is how does AI impact
        this distribution okay conventional
        economic analysis was that the left tail
        is screwed right the repetitive boring
        jobs are going to be done by Ai and it's
        game over for them I think something
        interesting is going on especially with
        knowledge work because now what you can
        imagine is that the whole distribution
        shifts to the right and gets narrowed
        right so I was talking to David alter at
        MIT as an economist there and we're
        exchanging thoughts I'm running some
        experiments about this in a couple a
        couple of companies Consulting companies
        and so forth around this and what we are
        seeing is actually something very
        interesting so what David said was look
        uh uh look at healthcare workers right
        nurse practitioners
        right there's a study that just came out
        a month ago that showed that Chad GPT is
        better accuracy than doctors and more
        empathy than doctors
        better accuracy and right because you
        know like if you see this distribution
        what do you call the person who
        graduates the last of their medical
        school
        doctor
        right so so now all of a sudden nurse
        practitioners could use this tool and be
        really good
        right think of the law firms paralegals
        same thing so we're seeing this this
        shift happen and this actually kind of
        kind of kind of amazing and then
        let me put this into context for us uh
        look we have the start of this uh of
        this crazy world was this this logo
        Mosaic browser okay Mosaic browser
        basically showed us what happens when
        the cost of information distribution
        goes to zero
        okay what happens when the cost of
        information distribution goes to zero
        right and then you've got Google and
        Baidu and the internet Age come out from
        that right and there's a five-year
        difference between the browser being
        invented and Google being invented and
        everything else it came through
        okay Napster remember that some of you
        still have illegal music Ray sitting in
        your servers uh right now on Amazon
        right what did Napster do lower the cost
        of music distribution unbundle the album
        right iTunes and Spotify come out okay
        lowering the cost and bundling iPhone
        what did iPhone do it lowered the cost
        of programming and distribution of
        programming and then we get tick tock
        so if you believe what I'm saying the
        question is what happens when the cost
        of cognition and creativity goes to zero
        what kind of companies we formed what
        does that look like
        okay and so for you guys you should
        think about AI as a co-pilot
        right super smart coppod never gets mad
        at you
        right you can available 24 7 you could
        ask it as many questions as you want to
        change your mind it doesn't matter like
        I wish my Ras were like that right like
        or my daughter was just like oh no this
        is a bad idea don't go back well yeah
        right but you're the captain and the
        captain is responsible for the co-pilot
        the Copa can go crazy sometimes
        hallucinate sometimes you guys have to
        be able to take care of that so
        immediately like that's the way to think
        about it but start to use it every day
        push push yourself to use it and it's an
        acquired skill right it requires
        practice
        um here's the thing
        there are two responses right now that I
        see with Executives the left side is
        what happened with the internet Barnes
        and Noble and Border said ah internet
        yes e-commerce new division bolt-on
        Amazon I'm gonna rethink my entire
        business I'm a rethink retail
        re-change the process
        and so today I see most Executives in
        coming companies are the left side oh
        yeah with both of us on or is it it's
        cute
        it's cute
        right not not realizing what this can do
        right and then when they do it it's a
        bolt-on instead of saying does it give
        me the opportunity to rethink I think
        that's the big challenge for incumbent
        companies in this space
        okay so um I'm gonna I'm over time so
        I'm just going to share with you we've
        got this great Institute it's incredible
        we're doing cool things you know we've
        got lots of labs we've got all these
        cool Labs uh
        uh
        uh
        I have no time uh anyway we've got like
        Labs on fintech crypto web 3 that still
        matters apparently uh Lish and AI right
        re-skilling value uh
        uh trustworthy AI digital emotion you
        name it we've got amazing Labs amazing
        faculty uh working with us both from HBS
        and also from the engineering school and
        from the medical school
        initial faculty will be growing our Labs
        over time we're basically trying to
        build a broad Institute model for
        research here at HBS okay and some
        insights uh I like this really amazing
        paper she showed you can do market
        research without the market
        using large language models you can
        basically replicate and get economically
        sufficient answers from chat GPT 3.5
        right great paper I'll send you a link
        so you can get this paper later okay uh
        we had two of our executive fellows
        really focus a lot on what means for
        startups right and again they're showing
        that AI startups are seeing 50 higher
        top line revenue than the peers and then
        talks a lot about what you need in terms
        of the teams as well
        um
        join our community okay for D cubed left
        hand side is a mailing list we have a
        ton of Outreach to alums we run case
        studies virtually we run you know
        two-day training sessions blah blah blah
        Lots going on left side is the meaning
        list
        uh right side is uh if you're interested
        in generative AI we have a Discord setup
        right and on June 8th we have our first
        live session uh talking about how these
        models work uh on Zoom you can join in
        for free and participate okay so both of
        these are available and then uh to get
        in touch with me you can ping me here
        and then I'm late by four minutes I
        apologize thank you very much it was a
        pleasure to see all of you
        thank you</p>
