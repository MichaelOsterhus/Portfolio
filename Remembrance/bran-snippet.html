        Whether we believe in God or not, one thing is undeniable: Humanity is made from the Earth.
    </p>
    <p>The principle of the seed in Game of Thrones doesn't make so much of an appearance as the principles of the 
        tree, stem, or root. The phrase "root and stem" is used several times in dialogue in which the removal of a problem 
        is what is being discussed. As for actual examples of pulling out a weed root and stem in the story, the destruction 
        of the Iron Throne and the slaying of the Night King are two obvious examples.  The desire for the Iron Throne 
        is the root of many problems, conflicts, and deaths in the story, and the Night King is the root of the White Walkers.
        It wouldn't be fitting to call them seeds, not in the way that Bran Stark is.

            For God thought fit to endue nature with a long duration, making the races that he was creating immortal, and giving them a participation in eternity. On which account he led on and hastened the beginning towards the end, and caused the end to turn backwards to the beginning: for from plants comes fruit, as the end might come from the beginning; and from the fruit comes the seed, which again contains the plant within itself, so that a fresh beginning may come from the end.

    It was recognized among some ancient people that what makes a seed grow is equivalent to a command contained 
    within in it. them in a way analogous to the way the Universe was created by "the Word" in the gospel of John.
    Hence, the symbolism of the seed repeatedly used by Jesus in the gospels such as in the parable of the sower 
    where the seed sown is likened to his message 
    of the kingdom of heaven. One implication of this is that the Universe is an expression of God's will, 
    i.e. that it isn't just a work of art, but, like the Bible, contains a message, unadulterated and unmediated, 
    and thus, when we walk through the world it could well be the case that God's parables are all araound us.
    But also, looking at the parables in the Bible, we could say that every human comes into this existence as a seed.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now, some might say this is obvious, every human begins when a single-celled organism we call a sperm which is just
    another word for seed, and which contains within it 
    a command which drives it to a destination with its other half. Within the womb of woman is the bridal chamber
    we call an egg
    where the chromosomes within the seed from her man meets its bride, the two come together as one, and a new life
    begins. But this life  
    must be born again, 
    once spoken by prophets, but the words spoken within the heart of every human, 
    such that we might say every human comes into this world as 
    a seed.
    </p>
    <p>Jesus in the New Testament gospels is quite fond of using seed as a symbol, and in primarily two different ways:
        <ul>
            <li>Seeds which grow into plants</li>
            <li>Seeds used for making bread</li>
        </ul>
    <p>We could include the making of wine in this list if we include the fruit which bears the seed in 
        the discussion as we ought to. The making of bread and wine involve similar processes:
        <ol>
            <li>Grains and grapes are crushed</li>
            <li>The unnecessary parts are removed</li>
            <li>What remains is combined with yeast</li>
        </ol>

    <p>
        But whether a grain is used for making bread or being sown again to grow wheat, the seed must cease to be.   
        Even if it is only a coincidence that the outer protective
        shell of a cereal grain is called "bran", we could

        <p>To a boy, Winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and 
            courtyards and tunnels spreading out in all directions.  In the older parts of the castle, 
            the halls slanted up and down so that you couldn't even be sure what floor you were on.
            The place had grown over the centuries like some mostrous stone tree, maester Luwin told him once,
            and its branches were gnarled and thick and twisted, its roots sunk deep into the earth.
        </p>
        <p>When he got out from under it and scrambled up near the sky, Bran could see all of Winterfell in a glance.
            He liked the way it looked, spread out beneath him, only birds wheeling over his head 
            while all the life of the castle went on below.  Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless,
            rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the First Keep,
            watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the cooks
            tending their vegetables in the glass garden, resltess dogs running 
            back and forth in the kennels, the silence of the godswood, 
            the girls gossiping beside the washing well.  It made him feel like he was lord of the castle,
            in a way Robb would never know.
        </p>
        <p>It taught him Winterfell's secrets too.</p>
        <p>(...)</p>
        <p>That was another thing he liked about climbing: it was almost like being invisible.</p>
        <p>(...)</p>
        <p>
            Most of all, he liked going places that no one else could go, 
            and seeing the grey sprawl of Winterfell in a way that no one else ever saw it. 
            It made the whole castle Branâ€™s secret place.

        The Way is ever without action,
        Yet nothing is left undone.

        If princes and kings can abide by this,

        All things will form themselves.

        If they form themselves and desires arise,

        I subdue them with nameless simplicity.

        Nameless simplicity will indeed free them from desires.


        Without desire there is stillness,

        And the world settles by itself.

            frozen shore and the great blue-white rivers of ice and the dead
            plains where nothing grew or lived.  North and north and north he looked,
            to the curtain of light at the end of the world, and then beyond that curtain.
            He looked deep into the heart of winter, and then he cried out,
