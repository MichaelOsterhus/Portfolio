            <h2>One Symbol To Rule Them All</h2>

            <img width="600px" src="img/phi.png">
            <p class="small caption"><em>Symbol of a Divine Relationship</em></p>

            <p>If we had to say Game of Thrones
                is about ONE thing, we would have to say it is about POWER or what it means to be a good RULER
                (a good ruler has a straight edge). 
                But it appears we have to say, at the least, Game of Thrones is about two things: <b>FIRE</b> and <b>ICE</b>.
                We can infer this much simply from the title of the book series the show is based on:
                'A Song of Ice and Fire'.  
            </p>
            <p>Unless we are to assume the main characters of the story are two mindless elements, 
                the title is our first taste of the use of symbolism, and a hint 
                that we may need to dig beneath the surface. 
                From this title we might guess that the story is about a contrast,
                a juxtaposition, 
                or even a clash of antipodal pairs. Fire and Ice do seem naturally inimical neighbors, 
                two which cannot cohabitate the same place. It does thus seem that conflict 
                is inherent in the story, but most stories are about the resolution of conflict, internal or external,
                whether through war or through love.
            </p>
            <p>
                It seems hardly a coincidence that in the very first overtly displayed 
                symbol of the show (pictured above) we see a 
                symbol that approximates a bisected circle, or at least, we can say,
                two equal but opposite halves 
                of a whole, a picture of marriage, but possibly another relationship.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h3>As Above, So Below</h3>
            
                <img style="float: right; margin: 30px; " width="140px;" src="img/Phi_glyph.png">
         
            <p>
                The symbol in question bears an uncanny resemblance to the Greek letter Phi.  Phi is used as a 
                symbol for Philosophy, but what makes it more significant in this context
                is the numerical ratio with which it is associated, a relationship which has garnered it names such as the 'Divine Proportion'
                and 'Golden Ratio'. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This ratio, 1.618... to 1 was known as early as the days of the ancient Greek mathematician, Euclid, and said to have 
                been used in Greek architecture and art, though it may not have attained divine status until the Renaissance and the publication 
                of a book in 1509 called 'On the Divine Proportion' by Luca Pacioli.
                Though
                it's not entirely clear why. The common explanations being that the ratio is aesthetically pleasing when used in art,
                and that it is commonly found in Nature.  However, many ratios are aesthetically pleasing when used in art, 
                and many ratios
                are found in Nature.
                What seems more likely to have earned phi the right to be deemed divine is its special relationhip between the larger 
                and smaller part of the ratio. This proportion reflects religious ideas about 
                the relationship between Heaven and Earth, God and Mankind, that from large to small, high to low, throughout the universe
                certain patterns repeat.
                In Hermeticism this idea is expressed simply as 'As above, so below'. In other words, the microcosm, the small universe,
                 is an image of the macrocosm, the big universe.

            </p>
           <div style="height: 400px;">
            <img style="float: right;" width="250" src="img/macrocosm.png">
            <div  style="width: 300px;">
                <p>

                    Aligned with the 'As above, so below' principle, phi could simply be taken as 
                    a sign that the story is a parable, that it signifies that what follows is like
                    something else.  For, again, this is how a parable works: using one thing, e.g.
                    a grain of mustard seed, to describe another, 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Mustard_Seed">
                        The Kingdom of Heaven
                    </a>.  After all, the word 'parable' comes from the Latin <em>parabola</em>
                    "comparison" which came to be used in math to denote a certain symmetrical shape,
                    alike on both sides of a dividing line, which 
                    Φ itself is not unlike.

           <h3>The Golden Mean</h3>
           <p>The Golden Ratio we just discussed is often confused with the Golden Mean. 
            Though the two are not the same, and it is not associated with the letter Phi, the Golden Mean 
            is relevant and noteworthy here. While the term 
            Golden Mean comes from Greek Philosophy, the concept exists in other religions and 
            philosophies and can be summed simply as "the Middle Way between two extremes".  
            It is for this concept that Buddhism is called "the Middle Way" and it is often depicted
            in the Buddha's realization that his path lay between strict asceticism and total self-indulgence.

                Now, if you are to have liberty and the combination of friendship with wisdom, you must have both these forms of government

            <h3>A Song of Salt</h3>
            <img style="float: right; margin: 30px; " width="140px;" src="/img/salt.png">
            <p>
                Another interpretation of the symbol is that it is, or is based on, the Alchemical 
                symbol for salt--salts in general. Alchemy is not just an ancient precursor of chemistry, but chemistry 
                nestled within the belief that the universe is God's Book, its signs are everywhere, and among these, few 
                are as sanctified as salt. Like phi, salt has a quality that might be deemed divine.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Western Alchemy, salts were seen to symbolize the "union of opposites" making them 
                religiously significant
                as a sign of balance, wholeness, prosperity, and wisdom. 
                This link between salt and the union comes from a quality salts posess, for 
                salt can be defined as: <i> any chemical compound formed from the reaction of an acid with a base...</i> <br/>

            <p>
                Acids and Bases are, of course, opposites, and they neutralize when united. So, salts 
                don't only symbolize two coming together as one, but also the stability or harmony that results from the union.

                Table salt, for example, is composed of two highly reactive elements, sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl). Whether they come
                together alone (Na + Cl) or in the form of an acid (HCl) and a base (NaOH) they not only neutralize each other 
                but together form a happily married couple (NaCl) highly prized in the ancient world as a disinfectant, a seasoning, 
                and preservative for keeping foods from going to ruin.

            The symbolic significance of common table salt (perhaps salts in general) is found in a variety of religions
                in the area of the Mediterrean including the religions of Rome and Greece, Judaism, and Christianity. Often used 
                in rituals involving purification, salt, being linked with unity, was also offered as a sign of trust
                or hospitality at gatherings.

            <p>
                 In Alchemy from Europe, Arabia, Persia, India and China, the first and foremost of opposites are the universal 
                 masculine and feminine principles which are widely symbolized by Sulfur and Mercury respectively. Whether
                 it is from qualities the two possess individually or together as a salt it is not clear why these 
                 two elements were chosen above others to represent the royal pair. 
                The two elements bound together form a red salt (mercury sulfide) known as cinnabar. 
                Cinnabar was mined as early as Neolithic times and to this day is the most common source of the 
                liquid metal Mercury. used as both a pigment and a medicine--despite being toxic--and considered 
                by alchmeists to be an ingredient 
                in creating the Philosopher's Stone, aka the Elixir of Immortality.
