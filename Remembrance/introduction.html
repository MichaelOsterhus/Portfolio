            The following is an analysis of the HBO series, Game of Thrones. 
            It is not a critique. It does not concern technical aspects of
             film-making nor storytelling, 
             but rather pries up the planks of a symbol-rich epic
             to uncover a possible import on the presumption that 
             Game of Thrones is, at its core, a religious
            parable, a philosophical discourse in entertaining disguise.
       
        </p>

        <p>
            It must be made clear that no specific religion, dogma, or philosophy
            is held here to provide sole contextual province in which symbols of
            the story are to be interpreted,  nor does there need to be one--unless we count all 
            the world's religions as one. 
            On the supposition that the God of this Universe has many faces,
            this analysis will draw from a palette of the world's sacred texts, myths, 
            and symbols in their service to paint a single
            coherent picture.

                    ...this is the remembrance of those things which our soul once saw while following God when, regardless of that which we now 
                    call being, (our soul) raised her head up towards the true being. And therefore the mind of the philosopher alone has wings; 
                    and this is just, for he is always, according to the measure of his abilities, clinging in remembrance to those things 
                    in which God abides, and in beholding which He is what He is. And he who employs aright these memories is ever being 
                    initiated into perfect mysteries and alone becomes truly perfect. But, as he forgets earthly interests and is rapt 
                    in the divine, the vulgar deem him mad, and rebuke him; they do not see that he is inspired.

            One subject relevant to an analysis of this kind is the subject of religious mysteries. A 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/mystery-religion">Mystery Religion</a> is a cult or religion 
            which employs 
            symbols, rituals, and/or allegories, i.e. "mysteries" to dispense spiritual teachings in a way obscured where 
            only an initiated few know the meanings of them. Parables such as those used by Jesus in the gospels fit into this category, 
            but so also do rites such as baptism, communion, marriage and the symbol of Christianity itself,

            Even if in principle and practice they exist(ed) elsewhere, the Mystery Religions are typically 
            associated with the Greco-Roman world as it was from ancient Greece and its myriad initiatory cults such as the 
            Eleusinian, Orphic, and Bacchic Mysteries that 'mystery' and its related words,
            'mystic' and '<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism">mysticism</a>' originate.  Though it would be contentious to call it a mystery religion, rites of initiation and
            the employment of mysteries persisted into Christianity as is seen in the 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://bereanbeacon.org/origin-of-the-seven-sacred-mysteries-of-orthodoxy/">Seven Sacred Mysteries</a>
             of the Eastern Orthodox Church and the 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dynamiccatholic.com/rosary/unlocking-mysteries-rosary.html">Mysteries of the Rosary</a>  
            of Roman Catholicism.   Of course, the idea of esoteric knowledge possessed by an intimate few and expressed 
            to the public in arcane symbolism is illustrated by Jesus himself in a section of the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke 
            known as the 'Parable of the Sower'. After explaining to his disciples the meaning of the parable, 
            he answer's their question about why he speaks to people in parables in a way as mysterious:
        </p>

                    it is not given. For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, 
                    from him shall be taken away even that he hath. Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; 
                    and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.

        <p> 
            If we take as a given that Jesus here is one with God, one implication is that God's mysteries 
            are anywhere and everywhere around us, for if Jesus speaks in parables, does God not also? 
            Could it be that Nature is ripe with symbolic meaning and Man in his mindless 
            ways may reveal more than the wisdom of babes without meaning to?

            <div style="width: 300px;">
                <p>In the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusinian_Mysteries">Eleusinian Mysteries</a> 
                    of ancient Greece, the changing of the seasons was put to work within the 
                    myth foundational to initiatory rites, aka the initiation myth--a story which, being contemplated,
                    helped to induce a spiritual evolution in initiates. 
                    In this case, the myth was of the Universal Mother,
                    known in Eleusis and elsewhere as Demeter, and her daughter--at first called Kore (maiden) until she was abducted by 
                    Hades, king of the underworld, and became his wife--thenceforth known as Persephone.  In her grief and wrath, Demeter 
                    caused vegetation to stop growing. To appease her, Hades consented to let Persephone return to life for 6 months 
                    out of the year. When Demeter is reunited with her daughter, she grants life to return to the world 
                    in a period of the year we call Spring.
                </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            In Eleusis, at Spring's arrival, a sequence of rites in the cult of Demeter known 
            as the Lesser Mysteries, rites of purification and preparation open to the public, were performed. 
            Later in the year around the Autumn Equinox, when Persephone returned to the underworld, 
            those who had been initiated would participate in the
            Greater Mysteries which were done in private and disclosure of what took place there was forbidden and punishable by death.
        </p>
            <p>
            For some, this myth is nothing more than an ignorant explanation for the changing of the seasons, for others it is an allegory 
            about reincarnation or the immortality of the soul.  In any case, it was the subject of rites which were meant to induce a mystical
            experience, meaning that, like the stuff of dreams, the changing of the seasons and other elements of the myth  
            serve a symbolic function. In other words, the myth is part of the mystery.
            </p>
            <p>
            Evidence for the idea that elements of Game of Thrones serve this same function is that elements 
            of the show are given symbolic meaning within the show itself. One example is 
            the equation of Winter with Death in Arya's statement "Winter came for House Frey". 
            Another is Daenerys's vision in the House of the Undying where the Wall is put to parabolic use 
            giving us a sequence that can be interpreted to predict her fate:

            Of course, it can't be said with any certainty
            what the intentions of George R. R. Martin were when writing the series of 
            novels the show is based on, nor how closely the creators of the show adhered to those intentions. 
            However, analyzing a story does not mean entirely to surmise the author's intent. 
            Indeed, when interpreting dreams we don't claim to know 
            what the dreamer meant, only what the dream means.  
        </p>

 
        <h2>Interpretation of Signs</h2>
        <p>
            When it comes to discussions on metaphysical or abstract concepts, the tools used are 
           symbol and metaphor.  For example, the idea of right, as in "We must do what is right." is expressed 
           in language using the metaphor of straightness.  The word "right" itself derives from an ancient Proto-Indo-European 
           <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/*reg-">root</a> which means "to move in a straight line." or 
           "to direct in a straight line." From the same root comes words such as correct, erect, direct, 
            regal, and ruler.  
           Not coincidentally, the word "wrong" comes from a root meaning "bent," and to call someone "crooked" is to say they are evil.
        </p>
        <p>This metaphorical link between straight--right and bent--wrong can be found in languages from around the world.
              In Chinese for example, there is 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>正 (Zhèng): positive, upright, straight, correct, just </li>
            <li>曲 (qū): song, yeast, bent, crooked, crook, wrong</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Despite having here an association which appears to transcend cultural boundaries, 
            can we say then that straight means right or make assumptions about what it 
            means any time we see a straight line in a work of art?  It does not seem 
            prudent.

        <p>This problem of interpreting signs is one harped on over and again in the very story we are here going to interpret.
            But, is it a point of Game of Thrones that we shouldn't interpret signs at all, or that we should, and we should be 
            careful when we do?
        </p>

        <p>In one of the very first scenes of the show we see a slain direwolf, the sigil of House Stark, killed by a stag, sigil 
            of House Baratheon.
            Five wolf pups are at first discovered next to the carcass and Jon Snow deduces that the 5 Stark children were 
            "meant to have them." In other words, it as a sign, or even Divine Intervention.  Is it?

            As for the direwolf being gored by the stag, it has been written of this that it is foreshadwing, the author's way 
            of cluing the audience in on future events, but it leaves the question: if it serves as foreshadowing for the audience, 
            should it not also be taken as foreshadowing for the Starks?  Is it not an omen?  If so, what does it say about the 
            world the story is set in and the forces at play?  If anything, does it not say the Starks should have been paying 
            attention, they should have been reading the signs?

            <h2>One Symbol to Rule Them All</h2>

            <br/>
            <img width="600px" src="img/symbol/phi.png">
            <p class="small caption"><em>Symbol of a Divine Relationship</em></p>
    
            <p>If we had to say Game of Thrones
                is about ONE thing, we would have to say it is about POWER or what it means to be a good RULER (a good 
                ruler has a straight edge). But we have to say, at the least, Game of Thrones is about two things: 
                <b>FIRE</b> and <b>ICE</b>. This much is evident in the title of the book series the show 
                is based on: 'A Song of Ice and Fire'.  
            </p>
            <p>
                While this is not an analysis of the book series (that may come later) the title is a clue 
                and our foremost use of symbolism, 
                for, unless we are to assume the main characters of the story are two mindless elements, 
                it is a sign that this duality is principle and should serve as a guide for any interpretation. 
                From the title we might guess 
                that the story is about a contrast, a juxtaposition, or even a clash of antipodal pairs. 
                Fire and Ice do seem naturally inimical neighbors, two which cannot cohabit the same place. 
                It does seem thus that conflict is inherent or inevitable in the story, but most stories are about the 
                resolution of conflict, internal or external, whether through war or through love.
            </p>
            <p>
                It seems hardly a coincidence that in the very first overtly displayed symbol of the show 
                (pictured above) we see a symbol that approximates a bisected circle, or at least, we can say,
                two equal but opposite halves of a whole, united, a picture of marriage, but possibly another relationship.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h3>As Above, So Below</h3>
            
                <img style="float: right; margin: 30px; " width="140px;" src="img/symbol/Phi_glyph.png">
         
            <p>
                The symbol in question bears an uncanny resemblance to the Greek letter Phi.  Phi is used as a 
                symbol for Philosophy, but what makes it more significant in this context is the numerical ratio 
                with which it is associated, a relationship which has garnered it names such as the 'Divine Proportion'
                and 'Golden Ratio'. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This ratio, 1.618... to 1 was known as early as the days of the ancient Greek mathematician, Euclid, and said to have 
                been used in Greek architecture and art, though it was not associated with the Greek letter then, 
                and it may not have had its apotheosis until the Renaissance 
                and the publication of a book in 1509 called 'De Divina Proportione' (On The Divine Proportion) by Luca Pacioli.
                For Pacioli, in simplest terms, the qualities that make phi divine are its:
                <ol>
                    <li><span style="color: #eee;">Simplicity</span></li>
                    <li>Resemblance to the <span style="color: #eee;">Trinity</span></li>
                    <li><span style="color: #eee;">Irrationality</span></li>
                    <li><span style="color: #eee;">Self-similarity</span></li>
                    <li>Link with the <span style="color: #eee;">Quintessence</span> (Fifth Element) via its prevalence in a dodecahedron</li>
                </ol> 
                Though Pacioli's arguments for what make phi divine likely did not come out of a vacuum, they are incongruent with  
                those typically given in modern times.
                Typical explanations nowadays are that the ratio is aesthetically pleasing when used in art, 
                Renaissance and Greek artists used it, and it is commonly found in Nature. However, many ratios are 
                aesthetically pleasing, and, if you look, you'll find many ratios in Art and in Nature. 
                That being said, the Golden Ratio does have a quality that makes it unique among ratios.
            </p>
            <p> 
                What seems most likely to have earned phi the right to be deemed divine is the unique relationship of the ratio
                Φ:1 to the sum of its parts and the religious tenet this uniquely expresses. 
                Dividing a line at a ratio of Φ:1 yields 
                a line where the proportion of the smaller part (1) to the larger (Φ) is the same as the larger to the whole (Φ+1). 
                (Φ + 1) / Φ = Φ. 
                This 'self-similarity', as Pacioli calls it, 
                reflects religious ideas about the relationship between Heaven and Earth, God and Mankind, or more appropriately 
                called here:  <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcosm%E2%80%93macrocosm_analogy">Macrocosm 
                    and Microcosm</a> . The idea can be found
                in the Bible with a prying eye, but it became more pronounced in the Renaissance with the infusion of Alchemy and Hermeticism 
                into Europe. It is, after all, the second of the 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://sacred-texts.com/eso/kyb/kyb04.htm">Seven Hermetic Principles</a>,
                the principle of correspondence, aka 'As Above, So Below', the idea that from high to low, large to small, 
                certain patterns repeat. For Hermeticists, this means the Known is a way to grasp the Unknown--the basic idea 
                behind religious parables.

                <p>
    
                    Aligned with the correspondence principle, phi could simply be taken as 
                    a sign that the story is a parable, that it signifies that what follows is an
                    image of something else.  For, again, this is how a parable works: using one thing, e.g.
                    a grain of mustard seed, to describe another, 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Mustard_Seed">
                        The Kingdom of Heaven
                    </a>.  However, it is not the claim of this analysis that the relationship between Fire and Ice 
                    is parabolic, yet the principle of correspondence still has a 
                    part to play in formulating the claim to come.

           <h3>Death Is Coming</h3>
           <img style="float: right; margin: 30px; " width="140px;" src="img/intro/theta.png">
           <p>Another Greek letter, theta, like phi has been used for various purposes in math, but 
            the most relevant use of theta here is as an abbreviation by the Greeks for 'thanatos' (death).
            As with many aspects of life, the Greeks were known to personify death in myth, and among the Orphic hymns
            is one for<a target="_blank" href="https://www.hellenion.org/thanatos/orphic-hymn-86-to-thanatos/">Thanatos</a>.
            Of course, death is arguably the main character of Game of Thrones, though it would be more agreeable to say 
            death is the antagonist.

           <p>It will be explored further in the analysis, but simply pointed out here that in religion there is more 
            than one kind of death.  Indeed, many religions speak of a rebirth, metamorphosis, or transmutation which necessitates 
            a kind of death in the way we might say a caterpillar dies when it becomes a butterfly. So the statement is attributed
            to the prophet Mohammed, "Die before you die." In a similar vein, Maester Aemon 
            tells Jon Snow in Game of Thrones "Kill the boy. Let the man be born." This is a recurring theme in the show. 
            </p>
            <p>Midway through 
            the series we see Sansa Stark wearing a pendant in the shape of the symbol in question though it has been turned
            so that the bisecting line is horizontal like in the letter theta. Besides the new jewelry, Sansa's unusually dark
            presentation and the feathers on her shoulders liken her to a raven or crow, a bird considered a herald of death
            and a symbol of the first stage of transmutation in Alchemy called 'the blackening' (nigredo), a psychic death of the Alchemist.  
            In this symbolism, which will 
            be deeper dug into later, we could interpret this to mean that Sansa has begun the process of transmutation,
            her young naive self in a state of decomposition and decay, making way for a new Sansa to rise from the dead little bird.

                    The Golden Ratio we just discussed is often conflated with the Golden Mean, though it appears to be
                    a separate concept entirely.  Because it is one of the themes of Game of Thrones and is related to another interpretation
                    of our symbol in question, the Golden Mean is given a brief introduction here. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The term Golden Mean refers to a concept common among the world's religions and 
                    philosophies which can be summed simply as "the virtuous mean between two extremes"
                    or "all things in moderation". Put another way we could say: there is a time to kill, and a time to heal,
                    a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing

            <h3>A Song of Salt</h3>
            <img style="float: right; margin: 30px; " width="140px;" src="img/symbol/salt.png">
            <p>
                Another interpretation of the symbol is that it is the Alchemical 
                symbol for salt. Alchemy is not just an ancient precursor of chemistry, but chemistry 
                nestled within the belief that the universe is God's Book, its signs are everywhere, and among these, few 
                are as sanctified as salt. Although the Alchemical symbol for saltpeter (&#128789;)
                is a better fit, it is what salts in general symbolize that concerns us. 
                Like phi, salts have a quality that might be deemed divine. While phi shows the 
                likeness between Heaven and Earth, salts show the union of the two.          
            </p>
            <p>
                In Western Alchemy, salts were seen to symbolize the "union of opposites" an idea apparent in a bisected circle.
                In addition to the salvific (derived from Latin <i>sal</i> = salt) qualities of some salts, this made them 
                religiously significant
                as a sign of balance, wholeness, prosperity, and wisdom. 
                This link between salt and the union comes from the fact that salts are formed from the marriage 
                of an acid and a base. <br/>

                <br/>
            <p>
                Acids and Bases are, of course, opposites--they neutralize when united. So, salts 
                don't only symbolize two coming together as one, but also the stability or harmony that results from the union. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Table salt, for example, is composed of two highly reactive elements, sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl). When they come
                together as an acid (HCl) and a base (NaOH) they not only neutralize
                but together form a happily married couple (NaCl) highly prized in the ancient world as a disinfectant, a seasoning, 
                and preservative for keeping foods from going to ruin.

                The symbolic significance of common table salt (perhaps salts in general) is found in a variety of religions
                in the area of the Mediterrean including the religions of Rome and Greece, Judaism, and Christianity, often used 
                in rituals involving purification as in the Book of 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2043%3A24&version=NIV">Ezekiel</a>.
                Being linked with unity, salt was also offered as a sign of trust
                or hospitality at gatherings.

                In Eastern and Western Alchemy, the first and foremost of opposites are the universal 
                masculine and feminine principles, the primordial pair whose copulation engendered the universe.
                Though gendered, these two are not bodied beings with reproductive organs.  Described as formless, 
                they are ascribed gender because of their opposing attributes and so have been represented by or 
                linked with a variety 
                of contrasting pairs.  Among those are:

            <h2>The Red King and the White Queen</h2>
            <p>
                Given the knowledge that George R.R. Martin's story is based partly on the Wars
                of the Roses, a decades long war in England between the Houses of York and Lancaster,
                 we might have guessed 
                that Game of Thrones would end the way the Wars of the Roses ended--with a wedding.
            </p>
            <P>
                With Henry Tudor's ascension to the throne and his marriage to 
                Elizabeth of York, the conflict and instability in England came to an end. 
                Henry's ancestry made him a claimant for the 
                throne from the Lancastrian side. So, like the neutralizing effect of compounding acids and bases, 
                the effective union of the two opposing houses into the House of Tudor opened the Tudor Dynasty 
                into an era peace and prosperity. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The Wars of the Roses were not called such at the time of the warring, and accounts conflict on whether the 
                Lancasters and Yorks actually used the red and white roses above as emblems of their houses. There is reason
                to believe this was a bit of propaganda added later meant to fit with Alchemical symbolism, but this is not 
                the place to make further argument for that.
                There seems consensus though the Tudor rose was created by Henry VII (Duke of Richmond) to symbolize 
                the union of the two houses.
                We see congruence with this in Shakespeare's final verses of Richard III, the last in a series of plays
                concerning the same wars we are discussing.

            <p>Of course, we see no such marriage in Game of Thrones, and marriages or proposals which fit well into 
                the symbolism outlined above, Joffrey and Sansa, Drogo and Daenerys, like others in the story, seem
                to make a case against marriage. Does this mean there is no hope for Fire and Ice, that their eternal 
                swirling dance is to only ever be a bloody tempest of war and strife?  Not if we consider a marriage of another kind.

            <!-- <p>George R. R. Martin has said that the Starks and Lannisters are based on the Houses York and Lancaster, 
                and were we only a season or two into Game of Thrones we might assume that the conflict between Starks 
                and Lannisters is the primary conflict to be resolved in the story, and thus that they represent 
                Fire and Ice in the story. This assumption is fitting given the associations between House Stark and Winter.
                But the correspondence goes even deeper when we compare it to Alchemical symbolism for the Red King and White Queen
                had their own associations?
            </p>
            <p>
                For that assumption we might conclude 
                that the two warring houses represent Fire and Ice in the story.
                these two houses seem, in the beginning, like the obvious choice would get 
                a Red King and White Queen to unite and end the conflict, but it doesn't take long 
                to realize this is not a retelling of the Wars of the Roses. However, there is
            </p>
            What is clear is that the show concerns itself with the following

                The Claim
            </h2>
            <p>
                Whether the symbol above is Phi, Theta, Salt, or something else, the claim of this analysis is the same: 
                Game of Thrones is about a Divine Relationship. Fire and Ice as 
                the subject of Martin's book are the couple concerned.
            </p>
            <p>Fire and Water were conceived of as opposites and symbols for primordial principles for millennia past. 
                That Martin gives us frozen water as a symbol, doesn't only make the two 
                more extreme opposites, but is a clue that the story concerns a transformation, a melting of the Ice--if we assume 
                that the story ends with a union.
            </p>
            <img width="600" src="img/intro/stone.png">
            
            <p>At last, the story does end with husband and wife coming together, but it is not 
                two people conjoining as one flesh, but a war-torn kingdom finally accepting her true king, the suitor who spoke to 
                her in parables while she kept a wall up between them for fear of death. Death came to her anyways, but in a way that 
                allowed her to be born again. As a 
                parable this corresponds to a reconciliation and a reunion between what struggles within the limits 
                of the human mind, and what lies beyond.
