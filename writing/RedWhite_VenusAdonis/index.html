                The aim of this work is to explore 
                Alchemical symbolism and how it may have been used in 
                Shakespeare's poem and reinterpretation of a Roman myth, 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/venus-and-adonis/read/">Venus and Adonis</a>,
                 especially in the colors red + white as potential representatives 
                of a gendered pair of universal principles as these are the principle components concocted in a process of spiritual 
                death and resurrection referred to
                throughout this work as 'Alchemical transmutation'. These universal parents may well have been what Venus and Adonis represented in esoteric interpretations 
                of the myth, and as such myths were intimately integrated into or even foundational to the Greco-Roman mystery religions and 
                mystic rites of initiation, a parabolic interpretation of the ancient tale is deserved--and Shakespeare's treatment of it even more so.
    
    
            <p>While we may never know if Shakespeare successfully rebirthed lead into gold, or if he even took the great labor of Alchemy upon himself,
                that he was at least familiar with Alchemy and its ideas is 
                apparent in his work. In Sonnet 33, for example, the poet gives a succinct summary of what Alchemy is in just the first four lines 
                using just a few symbols: the Sun, gold, earth, and water.

                And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
                Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
                Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
                With all triumphant splendour on my brow;
                But out, alack, he was but one hour mine,
                The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.

            <p>
                Here Shakespeare has taken Alchemy's two halves of the Universe, Heaven and Earth, and made lovers of them.  Is there more to Alchemy than this?
                The Sun in Alchemy is in the man's role, his element is gold, among others, and he is fire--all symbols of divinity. 
                As Shakespeare has it here, alchemy is synonymous with transformation from the mundane to the divine. 
                The Sun's fire, the transformative agent, is loving, kissing and caressing, 
                giving color to colorless streams  
                and endowing the lovelorn Earth with its luminous gold--the gist of Alchemical transmutation.

            <p>On the suspicion that Shakespeare was versed in Alchemical symbolism insomuch that he might write 
                an Alchemical allegory, his poem 'Venus and Adonis' was selected for investigation.  
                And there's a reason for that.

                <h2>Why 'Venus and Adonis' for Analysis</h2>
                <img width="700" src="img/rose.jpg">
                <p>From among Shakespeare's lush garden of poems, what makes '<b>Venus
                    and Adonis</b>' a ripe pick for picking apart is the mythological tradition from which it comes.
                    While Shakespeare tells only a portion of it, the larger story of a god and goddess annually parted by death, 
                    the winter of her grief, and the spring to new life and refreshed love in his resurrection and return
                    fits well with the general Alchemical narrative of transmutation which likewise centers on a pair of 
                    primordial lovers.
                </p>
                <img width="700" src="img/seasons.png">
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <p>The myth is, of course, bound to the cycle of the seasons where the regularly changing face of Nature is seen as
                    an expression of the absence or presence of divine love. In 'Donum Dei' (Gift of God), written in 1475, 
                    the four seasons of Nature's transmutation are matched with four stages of Alchemy 
                     and posited as footsteps for Alchemists to walk in.
                    The excerpt below introduces some common Alchemical symbols:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the principle colors: <b>black</b>, <b>white</b>, and <b>red</b>;</li>
                        <li>aspects of the <b>masculine</b> / <b>feminine</b> elements:
                            dry / moist and hot / cold.</li>
                    </ul> 

                    
              
                      
                </p>
                <p class="quote">
                    Therefore make white the black, and make red the white and you have the art (of Alchemy). For the year is divided into four parts, 
                    and so is our blessed work. The first is winter cold and moist, the second is ver, hot and moist, and flourishing. 
                    The third is the summer time, hot and dry, and red. The fourth is the harvest cold and dry, which is the time of 
                    gathering of fruit. This disposition colouring nature govern until such time it bring forth ripe fruit at pleasure.

                    Though it differs from the graphic 
                    above, mentioning only three colors, discrepancies like this are common in Alchemical texts. The key takeaway 
                    is that the seasons are matched with sequential
                    changes in a relationship between gendered pairs.  Winter as cold and moist, for example, is extreme feminine. 
                </p>
                <p>This application of gender dynamics to the seasons is found also in the humoral theory of health which persisted for 
                    thousands of years. The basic theory is that human health was determined by a balance of four bodily fluids called humors.
                    In a proto-psychology based on this idea there were also the four temperaments and these 
                    corresponded to the four seasons and their gendered aspects (e.g. Choleric = hot + dry): 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Melancholic (Sad) /  Winter</li>
                        <li>Sanguine (Happy) / Spring </li>
                        <li>Choleric (Angry) / Summer</li>
                        <li>Phlegmatic (Calm) / Autumn </li>
                    </ol> 

                    In the illustrations below from Deutsche Kalendar (German Calendar) 1498, the four temperaments, like the seasons, are depicted 
                    as a change in the relationship between a man and a woman.  From left to right in the same order as the list above.

                <h3>Nature and the Artist</h3>
                <p>
                    That the four temperaments would correspond to the four seasons is fitting, for whether people do it consciously or unconsciously 
                    we make connections 
                    between the face of Nature and our own internal emotional state. Happiness, for example, is typically associated 
                    with sunniness and cloudless skies.  Thus the seasons are a common object of symbolic 
                    use in poetry, and one question hanging over the 
                    study of mythology is whether myths such as that of Venus and Adonis are to be taken literally or metaphorically, 
                    being potentially
                    a poetic means of expressing spiritual teachings.
                    Shakespeare himself artistically uses the seasons to express how he perceives the presence and absence of his 
                    beloved in Sonnet 97, which could just as well have been Venus writing to the deceased Adonis. 
                </p>

                    How like a winter hath my absence been
                    From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
                    What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen,
                    What old December’s bareness everywhere!
                    And yet this time removed was summer’s time,
                    The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
                    Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
                    Like widowed wombs after their lords’ decease.
                    Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
                    But hope of orphans and unfathered fruit;
                    For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
                    And thou away, the very birds are mute;
                        Or if they sing, ’tis with so dull a cheer
                        That leaves look pale, dreading the winter’s near.
                </p>       
                <p>He continues on in this theme in the following sonnet of his sequence, but in this inserts an Alchemical idea 
                    similar to what we saw above.  Here it is "heavy Saturn" who has been transformed, made light-hearted, laughing 
                    and leaping, 
                    infused by a youthful spirit. 
                     Saturn, the dimmest of the Seven Classical Planets, whose day is last in the days of the week,
                     was linked with the dullest of the Seven Metals in Alchemy, lead.
                    So, Spring has taken a dour and dark metal and made it bright and alive like lightly leaping fire.
                    Here we also see the pairing of red and white in verses that echo what we will 
                    see again in the poem 'Venus and Adonis.'

                    Hath put a spirit of youth in everything,
                    That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.
                    Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
                    Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
                    Could make me any summer’s story tell,

                <h3>A Brief History</h3>
                <p>The story of Venus and Adonis
                    was one commemorated in many forms 
                    by many peoples of the Near East 
                    and Mediterranean tracing back to the cradle of civilization. The earliest known version of the story is the ancient Sumerian myth of 
                    Inanna (Lady of Heaven) and Dumuzi (Faithful Son)
                    found inscribed in tablets dating to 2100 - 2000 BCE. Though he was often described as a shepherd, Dumuzi was also known 
                    among the Sumerians as "The Bull of Heaven".
                    Inanna and Dumuzi came to be known as Ishtar and Tammuz (Damu) among the Babylonians.

                </p>
                <p>This couple subsequently came to be known as Astarte and Tammuz among the Phoenicians who exported the pair of deities 
                    to Greece along with the Semitic term <i>Adon</i> (Lord).
                    Adon shares the same root as the Hebrew <i>Adonai</i> used for God in the Bible where it also means Lord.  
                    This title of course became Adonis among the Greeks.  It is unknown where the name Aphrodite came from or even what it means, 
                    while Venus, it is known, comes from a Latin word <i>venus</i> which means "love, beauty, charm".

                    From the Sumerians to the Romans, the pair weren't just the subject of myth but also of annual rites. Among 
                    these were the ritual acts 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-14.htm">of women weeping</a> and beating their breasts in lamentation 
                    for the slain deity and the celebration of his resurrection and
                    reunion with his love in a rite known as the
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieros_gamos">Sacred Marriage</a>.  In Mesopotamia the Sacred Marriage ritual typically  
                    involved a priestess of the Goddess and a king, priest, or priest-king who may have served as actors, or were seen as 
                    incarnations of deity, performing the sacred sexual union. 
                    In the Adonia festivals of Greece a bridal bed would be prepared with the 
                    finest coverings, 
                    surrounded with offerings and/or adorned with flowers in a symbolic anticipation of Adonis' return from the dead and 
                    temporary reunion with Aphrodite.

                <h2>Adonis: the Field's Chief Flower</h2>
                <p>Although the ancient story of Adonis is believed told in the story of a plant or, perhaps more specifically, in a flower
                    which dies as a seed when submerged in soil making way for a new life to spring from the ground,
                    it could be argued that his story is of the annual death and resurrection of the Sun. 
                    As Nature's transmutation throughout the year hinges on the relationship between the Sun and the Earth, 
                    it is plausible that these are the two original 
                    characters of the myth.  But we needn't discard one idea for the other.

                <h3>Adonis, Celestial Sun or Terrestrial</h3>
                <p>Comparing this hymn to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theoi.com/Text/OrphicHymns1.html#7">Orphic Hymn to the Sun</a>, 
                    similarities are apparent, but regardless, this hymn appears to be referring to the Sun. The reference to Adonis  
                    as "Glory of the skies" but also as "Love's delightful flower" is a case where poetic sensibilities may come in 
                    handy, for we can simply view the bright bodies in the sky as a field of flowers to reconcile the apparent 
                    contradiction, but is that what was meant?  
                </p>
                <p>
                        This idea of the Sun as a flower is one mentioned by Zosimos, an Alchemist living in the 3rd to 4th centuries CE,
                    who describes the Sun as a "flower of fire" apparently referring to the primordial Fire which engendered the Universe 
                    through copulation with the primordial Waters--which makes a possible link with Eros. 
                    Eros (Love) which is the original Greek word 
                    used in the above hymn, was in some Greek cosmogonies the Father of all.  Hence, "(Eros') delightful flower" 
                    in the hymn could likewise be a reference to the Sun. 
                    Note that Zosimos in the quote below, doesn't only refer to the Sun as a flower, but also the Alchemist who is the copper 
                    that must bloom.
                </p>
                <p class="quote">
                    Just as there is a sun, a flower of fire, the celestial sun, right eye of the world; likewise copper, if it blooms 
                    (which is to say, if it takes the color of gold) by purification, then it becomes an earthly sun, 
                    which is king on earth, as the sun is king in heaven.
                </p>
                <p class="quote citation">--Zosimos of Panopolis</p>
            
                <p>Shakespeare, in his poem, describes Adonis as an earthly sun through the mouth of Venus in a stanza that recalls 
                    the sonnet quoted at the beginning and one we will look at later written for his beloved whose bright eye,
                    like the Sun, "gild(s) the object whereupon it gazeth": </p>
                <p class="quote shake">
                    The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,
                    And, lo, I lie between that sun and thee.
                    The heat I have from thence doth little harm;
                    Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me,
                        And were I not immortal, life were done
                        Between this heavenly and earthly sun.
                </p>
                <p>Already in the information provided we have reason to believe Adonis is equivalent to the 
                    masculine principle of Alchemy which is represented by the Sun, among other things, 
                    though rather than being the Father of all things in the mythology which has followed him, 
                    there is more reason to believe he is the Son, the Seed of all things.

                <h2>Venus: Magna Mater</h2>
                <p>It would sound dubious that the English word <i>matter</i> derives from the Latin word for mother assuming a 
                    missing history of how the Universe was created in a Greco-Roman view, or rather, how it was conceived.               
                    Indeed, the widespread existence of gendered languages, such as Latin and Greek, 
                    stands as evidence to a prehistoric belief that 
                    the Universe is the offspring of two primordial parents, and it is their polar qualities that allow for Nature to attain 
                    its life-promoting balance. Nature needs both the hot ascending fire and the cold descending rain. And so, various facets of 
                    Nature were tied to one of these two archetypes of gender--something we see done explicitly in Alchemy where hot and cold,
                    dry and wet, day and night, summer and winter were seen as but a few of the many faces of the two who conceived the Everything. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A common conception of these primary masculine and feminine elements is 'Father Heaven and Mother Earth'. 
                    While these appellations are often interpreted as 'sky and ground' they are more appropriately interpreted as
                    'spirit and matter' for, in the ancient view, the cosmos had an immaterial and insensible 
                    half associated with order, perfection, timelessness, and consistency, and a half perceptible by the 
                    senses 
                    associated with chaos, imperfection, time, and change which is called 
                    'material' from <i>mater</i> the Latin word for mother. It was these two halves which made up the being we 
                    call Universe in a way analogous to a human being, a body possessed of a spirit.
                    <!-- In Greece, words had gender but so too did numbers, 
                    odd numbers were masculine, even numbers feminine, but the number 1 was neither. The first masculine number 
                    in their view
                    is 3.  This mirrors accounts of Creation of the Universe which hold that 1, an androgynous or hermaphroditic being split 
                    into 2, the Father and Mother. The Father, 1, then inseminated the Mother, 2, by means of 3, the Seed, which, planted in his Mother, 
                    began to germinate.  -->

                <p>
                    "The spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters" in the Book of Genesis, is a picture of the first two gendered principles 
                    in erotic posture just prior to 
                    consummating an act of Love.  The waters here--and in other religious contexts--represent the soil of creation, 
                    a formless substance to be informed by the issued seed, making her the Mother of all things.

                <h3>The Orphic Hymn to Aphrodite (Venus)</h3>
            <p class="quote shake">
                Heavenly, smiling Aphrodite, praised in many hymns,
                sea-born, revered goddess of generation, 
                you like the nightlong revel and you couple lovers at night, 
                O scheming mother of Necessity. Everything comes from you; 
                you have yoked the world, and you control all three realms. 
                You give birth to all, to everything in heaven, 
                upon the fruitful earth and in the depths of the sea...
            </p>
    
                <p>At some point in the past, people had gathered that seeds grow by a word or command 
                    which is contained within them and they made a connection between this process 
                    and the Universe's own germination.  
                    So the universal seed was called by Greek philosophers <i>logos spermatikos</i> which means 
                    'seminal word'. This same Word is introduced in the Gospel of John:
                </p>
                <p class="quote">
                    In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
                    He was with God in the beginning. 
                    Through him all things were made; and nothing that has been made was made but through him. 
                    In him (is) life, and that life (is) the light of all mankind. 
                    The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
                </p>
                <p>What is not present in John is the Word's other half, the feminine princple, the soil of creation from which burgeoned 
                    the Tree of Life we call Universe. Krishna says of this tree in the Bhagavad Gita 
                    that its roots are above and its branches are below. 
                    It is possible that Adonis as "sweet plant of Aphrodite" refers to this same offspring 
                    for in some versions of the myth Adonis is not only the lover of the Goddess, but also her son.

                <h2>The Divine Hermaphrodite</h2>
                
                <p>Father Heaven and Mother Earth are common depictions of the primordial parents, but what is found along with this 
                    depiction, though less commonly, is the idea that these two are halves of one being.  Furthermore there is found the 
                    idea that the archetypal or complete human is a hermaphrodite, made in the divine image, both male and female.
                    Perhaps nowhere is this more apparent than in Alchemy where the hermaphrodite is repeatedly used as a symbol for the 
                    culmination of the Alchemical process. 
                </p>
                <!-- <p>When in the Bible it is stated, "God created mankind in his own image (...) male and female he created them."
                    one of the meanings of this statement is the image of God is male and female.  What's more, the Hebrew word translated 
                    as "mankind" in the sentence,<i>ha-Adam</i>, where "ha" is a definite article (i.e. the Adam) also 
                    means "man, human", and, of course, is simply left untranslated elsewhere in Genesis as "Adam". In other words, 
                    Adam (the Human) was made male and female in the image of God--is one possible translation, and one that makes sense 
                    given the Bible's assertion that man and woman originate from one body. 
                    In addition, the word translated as "rib" later in the text, the supposed source of Adam's wife Eve, 
                    is translated in other instances as "side" hermaphrodite similar to what is depicted in the image of Shiva and Shakti 
                    together as one entity known as Ardhanarishvara, "The Lord who is half woman". 
                 </p> -->
  
                 <p>
                    Hermaphroditic deities were more common in the ancient world than people might think.  An argument that the Book of Genesis 
                    describes how God created Adam 
                    "male and female" in God's image could be made, but this is for another article.  On the same note, we see
                    in Plato's Symposium that the first humans where two-in-one pairs called Androgynes (andro = "man", gyne = "woman") and in 
                    Egypt there is a creation myth that describes how the Universe originated from the separation of androgynous deities 
                    into male/female couples. The subject 
                    is relevant here because the Hermaphrodite is one of the most prominent symbols of wholeness and completeness 
                    in Alchemy but too the very term comes from the mythology around Aphrodite and her child.

                        implying that this wheel of time is itself a hermaphrodite, ascending on one side while it descends on the other.

                        alone in the center.  Being the messenger of the gods, Mercury was seen as a union of opposites, of Heaven and Earth.

                        Mercury's day is in the middle of the week.  Not coincidentally, the god Mercury (Hermes) was 
                        associated with the "union of opposites".

                    Not far away was the Greek myth told by Aristophanes in Plato's 'Symposium' of the Androgynes, the first created beings 
                    who were two humans fused in one.  Though the name Androgyne translates as "man-woman" the Androgynes came in man-man, woman-woman 
                    and other combinations according to Aristophanes who uses the myth to explain how sexual relationships are essentially one
                    half of a human looking for its other half. 
                    Given the cross-cultural influence of Jews and Greeks, when after describing the creation of mankind the Bible says, 
                    "A man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." 
                    the idea between the lines 
                    here is that man and woman are <b>partial</b> beings and when they come together they don't just become one, they become whole.  
                    The hermaphrodite is the <b>whole</b> being.

                    Already in the Orphic hymn to Adonis we saw the God referred to as "Female and Male", but so too was Venus/Aphrodite 
                    seen as a hermaphrodite in certain contexts--and her child. 
                    Cross-gender behavior appears a permanent fixture in Goddess worship 
                    from the early days of the Sumerian city-states to the end of the Roman Empire, apparently due to the 
                    belief that the deity is both sexes.

                    is a nurturing goddess. In his Atthis Philochorus, too, states that she is the Moon and that men sacrifice 
                    to her in women's dress, women in men's, because she is held to be both male and female.

                <h3>Salmacis and Hermaphroditus</h3>
                <p>
                This story is similar to Ovid's tale of Venus and Adonis but for that the man being chased by an adoring woman, 
                doesn't die, not in the literal sense, nor does a flower grow in the spot where death consumed him.  
                Rather, when Salmacis sees Hermaphroditus 
                bathing in the spring she haunted, being immediately enraptured, she wraps herself around him and prays to 
                the gods that she and the son of Hermes and Aphrodite should never part. The gods grant her request, 
                fusing the two beings into one body, a single being both male and female. One question that appears begging to be asked
                is: is the merging of male and female into one what Adonis had in store had he chosen to love Venus instead of going hunting?
                Is that the meaning of the red and white flower that springs from his blood?</p>

                        the being divine.  The being holds what is apparently meant to represent the Philosopher's Stone in the semblance of an egg.
                        The image in the book is adjacent a parable on how the Stone is like an egg, uniting the 4 opposites (hot/cold, dry/wet)
                         into one.

                    In Ovid's telling of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus, red and white appear together also, only briefly, when Salmacis attempts 
                    to gain affection and causes Hermaphroditus to blush:

                <p class="quote">
                    ‘After this the naiad was silent. A <span class="red">red</span> flush branded the boy’s face. He did not know what love was:

                </p>
                <p>Note that here Ovid is comparing Hermaphroditus to a damsel in distress in the Moon who blushes because men are fighting to rescue 
                    her.  Shakespeare gives Adonis a similar treatment when he writes: 
                </p>
                <p class="quote shake">
                    He burns with bashful shame; she with her tears
                    Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks.
                    Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs
                    To fan and blow them dry again she seeks.
                      He saith she is immodest, blames her miss;
                      What follows more she murders with a kiss.

            <!-- <p>One thing that potentially relates this story to that of Adonis is that Hermaphroditus is the son of Aphrodite.  The most
                renowned son of Aphrodite is of course he whom the Greeks called Eros, and the Romans, Cupid.  Typically known as the god of Love,
                 in some myths Eros is not just Love, but the Love which created the Universe by copulating with the primordial Chaos,
                as can be seen in Aristophanes play, 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0026%3Acard%3D685">Birds</a>. 
                This role potentially links him with what could be called the Divine Hermaphrodite, 
                a generic term for the primordial unity which split into 
                Heaven and Earth, Fire and Water, Sun and Moon, the masculine and feminine aspects of Alchemy.
            </p> -->
            <p>Hermaphroditus was a popular deity among the Greeks (Hermaphroditos in Greek) and Romans, and there are many statues carved in veneration.
                 Interestingly,
                the common depiction of the being described as both male and female is as a woman with a penis and testicles.
                Recall that in the Orphic
                hymn, Adonis is called 'Female and Male'.

            <p>The concept of a hermaphrodite like what is depicted above, what we call a transgender woman, was not foreign to 
                Shakespeare.  Indeed, the Bard dedicated the majority of his sonnets to such a person, though it doesn't become obvious until 
                Sonnet 20 where Shakespeare makes it known the man he's been writing to was meant to be a woman but given a penis by 
                a-doting Nature that he should give women pleasure.

                <h2>A Philosophy of Fire</h2>
                <p>
                    The myth of Venus and Adonis is seen as a primitive attempt to explain the changing of the seasons, but given 
                    what we've seen in the Orphic hymns we could say that the myth is just an observation of the regularly 
                    changing relationship between the Sun (Adonis) and the 
                    Earth (Venus) turned into a romance, but that leaves the 
                    question: why make a myth out of it?
                </p>
                <p>One answer we have seen already: the cycle of the seasons is a natural precedent as parable of spiritual transformation in Alchemy.
                    Evidence that it may have served a similar purpose in the ancient Mediterranean is found in the ancient mystery religions of the area.
                    The mystery religions/cults were initiatory groups which buried spiritual teachings in ceremonies, symbols, and myths,
                    i.e. "mysteries" many of which were shared openly with the public while their true meaning was not. 
                    It is from these groups that we get terms such as "mystic/mysticism" 
                    and possibly even the word "myth". The only argument to be made for that here is that myths were intimately integrated 
                    into mystic rites of initiation in such a way that we could call them fundamental. It was common for mystery religions
                    to be centered on a single myth and these stories typically concerned the subject of death and resurrection or the quest for 
                    immortality--the same as Alchemy. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    One such myth was that of Demeter and Persephone, the central myth of the Eleusinian Mysteries.  Like the myth of Venus and Adonis, 
                    this story of a mother and her daughter was linked with the changing of the seasons and was so integral in cult practices 
                    that the main rites known as the Lesser and Greater Mysteries were performed on or around the Equinoxes, the times 
                    of transition for mother and daughter. The Lesser Mysteries which were 
                    open to the public were performed at the Spring Equinox when Persephone emerged from the underworld.  The Greater Mysteries, 
                    reserved for initiates were performed at the Autumn Equinox when Persephone returned to the realm of the dead. The Eleusinian Mysteries,
                    despite being tauntingly mysterious are among the better known mystery religions.  It is known that religious mysteries centering 
                    on Venus and Adonis existed, but little is known about them. However, if we take as a given that they existed, we have reason to believe 
                    the story of the two lovers served as an initiation myth.  In other words, there is a supposed wisdom buried in it as
                    the myth isn't really about Nature's transformation, but about ours. 
                </p>
                <p>One thing the myths of Demeter and Persephone and Venus and Adonis have in common besides the impetus for seasonal change, is 
                    the fact they center on a love relationship.  It's not that Adonis has returned to life that causes plants to grow, but 
                    that he has returned to his love.

                <p>Venus is often deemed the Goddess of Love, her only-begotten child in some accounts is Love, and, in some accounts,
                    it was this Love which created the Universe by making love with the primordial Chaos. To love then is an act of 
                    worship or devotion to the primal mover of all things, and so it is fitting that in this region and time there appears 
                    to be not a straight line

                    So, we see the nation of Israel depicted in the Bible as God's wife, in India souls devoted to Krishna are 
                    portrayed as women in stories and in paintings, 
                    and in Greek myth, Psyche, 
                    the personification of Soul, is represented as a woman in Soul's encounter with Love. 
                    Love in the end becomes her husband, and she his wife,
                     and in so doing, Soul becomes divine.

                    we can't separate this from Relationship.  All religions hinge on relationship.  Alchemy is no different. Humanity exists
                    in a relationship with the Universe, and with that relationship comes responsibility which is not to be confused with obligation,

                <p>The myth of Venus and Adonis is but one of many Greco-Roman myths of a certain type: transformation myths which center 
                    on a love pursuit.  This type of myth is congruent with Alchemy at large, for in general there is no Alchemy without transformation

                <h2>Venus and Adonis in Ovid's 'Metamorphoses'</h2>
                <p>
                'Metamorphoses' is a compendium of Greco-Roman transformation myths in 15 books gathered by the Roman poet Ovid in 8 CE. 
                Written as a poem, Metamorphoses begins with the creation of the Universe as a differentiation of 
                the primordial Chaos into into ordered parts and transitions through loosely connected myths of mortals, immortals, lovers,  
                enemies, and other numerous things culminating in the deification of the Roman Emperor, Julius Caesar. Taken all together a history
                from the first how a god came to be enthroned upon the Earth could 
                be seen as one big picture of Alchemical transmutation. Not surprisingly, Metamorphoses, was a source of inspiration for Alchemists, 
                as Harvard classicist, Edward 
                Kennard Rand, is quoted in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.academia.edu/168303/_Ovid_and_the_Alchemists_">Ovid and the Alchemists</a>
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
                Ovid’s text is made a quarry for the alchemist’s pick and shovel. The 
                fable of Deucalion and Pyrrha, for instance, betokens, like the twin peaks 
                of Parnassus, the masculine and the feminine elements among the metals, 
                that is, gold and silver, from the union of which the philosopher’s stone 
                is produced. In this fashion, the whole poem is subjected to the fatal touch 
                of Midas; Ovid’s gold is converted into the baser metal.
            </p> 
            <p>Of course, one of the myths told in Metamorphoses is that of Venus and Adonis, and it is this telling which 
                is believed to be the source of inspiration for Shakespeare fifteen centuries later. There are some key differences.
                Unlike Shakespeare's version, Ovid's tale of Venus and Adonis has three transformation myths in one. 
                The two tales Shakespeare leaves out are:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><h4>Myrrha and Cinyras.</h4>
                    <p>
                        Story of the mother of Adonis being turned into a Myrtle tree to escape her enraged father who wanted blood after 
                        discovering she had deceived him into having sex and impregnating her. 
                        Adonis was born from the tree.
                    </p>
    
                </li>
                <li><h4>Atalanta and Hippomenes</h4>
                    <p>
                        The story of a race between a woman who refused marriage and a man who was in love with her, 
                        racing to win her hand or die trying, then winning by tossing Golden Apples of the Hesperides to lure the woman 
                        off track and their subsequent 
                        transformation into lions for snubbing the Goddess telling the story to Adonis, Venus.  
                    </p>
    
                </li>
            </ol>
    
                <p>Though Ovid was not the only ancient author to recount it, the story of Atalanta and Hippomenes was one such 
                    taken for Alchemist plunder. The oft-mentioned Alchemical 
                    text 'Atalanta Fugiens' by Michael Maier (1617) takes its name (Atalanta Fleeing) from this story and
                    Maier introduces his book with his own distilled rendition of it tinted with Alchemical symbols: 
                </p>
                <p class="quote shake">
                    Three Golden Apples from the Hesperian grove.
                        A present Worthy of the Queen of Love.
                    Gave wise Hippomenes Eternal Fame.
                        And Atalanta's cruel Speed O'ercame.
                    In Vain he follows 'till with Radiant Light,    
                        One Rolling Apple captivates her Sight.    
                    And by its glittering charms retards her flight.    
                        She Soon Outruns him but fresh rays of Gold,
                    Her Longing Eyes & Slackened Footsteps Hold,
                        'Till with disdain She all his Art defies,
                    And Swifter then an Eastern Tempest flies.
                        Then his despair throws his last Hope away,
                    For she must Yield whom Love & Gold betray.
                        What is Hippomenes, true Wisdom knows.
                    And whence the Speed of Atalanta Flows.
                        She with Mercurial Swiftness is Endued,
                    Which Yields by Sulphur's prudent Strength pursued.
                        But when in Cybel's temple they would prove
                    The utmost joys of their Excessive Love,
                        The Matron Goddess thought herself disdained,
                    Her rites Unhallowed & her shrine profaned.
                        Then her Revenge makes Roughness o'er them rise,
                    And Hideous feireenesse Sparkle from their Eyes.
                        Still more Amazed to see themselves look red,
                    Whilst both to Lions changed Each Other dread.
                        He that can Cybell's Mystic change Explain,
                    And those two Lions with true <span class="red">Redness</span> stain,
                        Commands that treasure plenteous Nature gives
                    And free from Pain in Wisdom's Splendor lives.
    
                                                --Michael Maier, Atalanta Fugiens
                </p>
                <p>Describing Atalanta's swiftness as "mercurial" reinforces the idea of one fleeing Love, 
                    for when extracting mercury by fire's heat from its naturally occurring salt, mercury sulfide, mercury flies up as a vapor 
                    while her other half, sulfur, remains.  Hence mercury was seen among Alchemists as one who flees the fire, while sulfur (aka brimstone),
                    was seen as like fire.
                    Maier here has mercury eventually yielding 
                    to "Sulphur's prudent strength" which all together reinforces the idea of transmutation as a 
                    Love pursuit which the Alchemist eventually yields to, being in the woman's role.
            
                 </p>
                 <p>Perhaps making the connection between the two tales, Shakespeare has Adonis more like Atalanta, 
                    bashful, reluctant, even "frosty", which may be why he leaves the story of Atalanta out.
                    Venus thus is in the man's role in Shakespeare's poem, and perhaps as a substitute for Atalanta's story he has 
                    Venus describe a hare being chased, and also how a male horse reacts when he sees a female he is hot for, 
                    likewise linking him with fire.

                    His ears up-pricked, his braided hanging mane
                    Upon his compassed crest now stand on end.
                    His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,
                    As from a furnace, vapors doth he send.
                        His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,
                        Shows his hot courage and his high desire.
                 </p>
                 <p>In this poem, Venus is regularly linked with fire as in:</p>
                 <p class="quote shake">
                    She red and hot as coals of glowing fire,
                    He red for shame but frosty in desire.
                 </p>
                <p>One point where Ovid and Shakespeare are in agreement 
                    flower grown from Adon's blood
                    they appear to be on the same page. Shakespeare says:
                </p>
                <p class="quote shake">
                    And in his <span class="red">blood</span> that on the ground lay spill’d,
                    A <span class="red">purple</span> flower sprung up, chequer’d with <span class="white">white</span>;   
                      Resembling well his <span class="white">pale</span> cheeks, and the <span class="red">blood</span>
                      Which in round drops upon their <span class="white">whiteness</span> stood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that Shakespeare uses purple here to denote the color of blood.  In his time purple wasn't restricted to the 
                    hue it is now and could be used for a range of hue including dark or rich reds. Shakespeare often uses purple 
                    when describing blood's color. Ovid
                    tells us the flower is a "blood-colored anemone", 
                    leaving us with one flower as an obvious candidate.
                </p>
                <img width="700" src="img/anemone.png">
                <p> The Red Crown Anemone, or the anemone coronaria.  The flower blooms in a variety of colors, 
                    but there is a peculiar variant with petals around its black crown that transition from white to red.  
                    A flower native to the Mediterranean,
                    its name is supposed to derive from the Greek <i>anemone</i>,
                    "windflower".  Ovid is in agreement stating the flower is "too easily fallen, the winds deflower it, 
                    which are likewise responsible for its name, windflower". Other sources say it is so called because the 
                    flower will not bloom until it has been touched by the wind.
                    Some believe the name anemone comes from the Arabic name of this particular flower, shaqa'iq An-Nu'man (wounds of An-Nu'man)
                    and that An-Nu'man derived from an epithet for Tammuz, the Semitic counterpart of Adonis.
                    The Red Crown Anemone is the national flower of Israel.

                <P>The fact that the flower which pays tribute to the slain deity is painted in the three principle colors of Alchemy, 
                    and that Adonis himself is called a flower, lends to the idea that, in blooming,
                     the Alchemist becomes Adonis, the deity resurrected, a sun on Earth, and, last but not least, the Divine Hermaphrodite
                     the masculine and feminine principle united.

                The symbol of chemistry is drawn from the creation by its adepts, who cleanse and save the divine soul bound in the elements, 
                and who free the divine spirit from its mixture with the flesh.

                Alchemy, in brief, is the predecessor of modern science nestled in the belief that the universe is an expression 
                of God's Word, that truths
                bound in parables abound in Nature from the seldom seen formation of salts to the everyday apparent changing of the seasons. 
                Hence, the tendency in teaching the Art--because it was esoteric--to transmit knowledge in allegory or image using 
                symbolism which had a natural precedent, e.g. fire, salt, gold, seed, etc.. Were it possible to sum the concern
                of these teachings into a single word, it would have to be transformation</b> or <b>evolution</b>, for as the world turns, 
                it <b>turns out</b>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So, similar to the way a seed moved by sunlight metamorphoses soil and water into the unearthly loveliness of a rose, so Alchemists 
                sought to transform their own being from something gross (like lead) into some divine thing worthy of show--though there is a key difference.
                Alchemists saw humans as participants in Creation, and thus made the distinction between Nature and Art as like 
                that between the left hand and the right.

                from the ground, but for the edible part to be separated from the chaff, ground into flour, and mixed with leaven to make 
                bread requires the intervention of Art. So, while a seed refiguring itself into a plant was used as a 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/John%2012%3A24">religious parable</a>, taking wheat Nature had produced
                and turning it into bread would be a better illustration of Alchemy's transmutation.  So, Alchemy was sometimes called the Royal Art, 
                and the enterprise of bringing the light of a buried deity to life was called the Magnum Opus (Great Work).
    
            </p>
    
    
            <p>In only the last year did I start to study Alchemy and become familiar with its symbols. 
                Though I am no expert, some things have become apparent.
                One is that there is no canon of Alchemy, but still there are some ideas and corresponding symbols which 
                are consistent, such as the belief in a universal masculine and feminine principle
                which are often represented by what were conceived of as opposites or gendered pairs: the metals Gold and Silver, 
                the celestial bodies Sun and Moon, the elements Sulfur and Mercury, or 
                a pair of the Four Elements, Fire and Water, sometimes Air (Wind) and Water.  They were also represented
                by the <span class="red">Red King</span> and <span class="white">White Queen</span>, or simply red and white.
            </p>
            <p>
                The "union of opposites" is a major theme of Alchemy, and for those who practiced it the world was
                full of opposites.
                 All opposites were 
                initially one within an inchoate and formless mass (the mother) before the germination of the seed began to separate them, 
                and so creation was seen as a descent 
                from unity into division like a tree growing upside down. 
                
                A tale along these lines comes from Ovid's 'Metamorphoses'--a book about transformation.

            <p class="quote">
                Before there was earth or sea or the sky that covers everything, Nature appeared the same throughout the whole world: 
                what we call chaos: a raw confused mass, nothing but inert matter, badly combined discordant atoms of things (...)
                Nothing retained its shape, one thing obstructed another, because in the one body, cold fought with heat, 
                moist with dry, soft with hard, and weight with weightless things.

            <p>The process of transmutation which Alchemists took upon themselves
                often involved uniting such opposed components of their own being into one, an ascension from division to unity, 
                though what exactly this means is not clear
                and it should be pointed out that Alchemical texts are often deliberately obscure. On right, a diagram 
                by the Alchemist, George Ripley, depicting the stages of transmutation as a dual-stemmed plant crowned with a golden flower. 
                Note also the red and white buds. Below, a sample from 
                a text titled 'The Hermaphrodite Child of Sun and Moon' to give a taste of how cloudy 
                the language can be but also note how the author, apparently speaking on behalf of that which Alchemists
                seek, describes himself as "dry water".
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
    
                Hermes called me the Sun and the Moon. Riplaeus called me the green
                lion. Our author called me hermaphrodite, but I pay no attention to
                that. It makes no difference. Nor does it matter what the sophists
                call me, for they learn nothing for all their trouble except: (1) I
                am One Substance, not two; (2) In me is Bernard's little fountain;
                (3) I am dry water, subtle pure; (4) I am raised up by the power
                of Mars, as commanded by Philaleth, the famous Adept who
                coagulates my esoteric nature with Mercury.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                The paradoxical nature of "dry water" is likewise used by Shakespeare in 'Romeo + Juliet' in Romeo's 
                paradox-filled monologue about brawling love. 
    
            </p>
            <p class="quote shake">
                O me! What fray was here?
                Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
                Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
                Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
                O any thing, of nothing first create!
                O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
                Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
                Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
                Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!

            <p>In one text considered fundamental among Alchemists, the Corpus Hermeticum, 
               Hermes likewise describes the object of the Alchemist's pursuit
                in contradictory terms, yet in less muddy language than the previously quoted Alchemical text. 
                That one thing is the ultimate reality,
                the one thing that is true--which is not a thing 
                at all:
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
                <b>Tat:</b> What then is true, Thrice-greatest One?<br/><br/>
    
                <b>Hermes:</b> That which is never troubled, son, which cannot be defined; that which no color hath, nor any figure, 
                which is not turned, 
                which hath no garment, which giveth light; that which is comprehensible unto itself, which doth not suffer change; 
                that which no body can contain.<br/><br/>

                yet blows (dry) like air, how shalt thou this perceive with sense - the that which is not solid nor yet moist, 
                which naught can bind or loose, of which in power and energy alone can man have any notion - and even then it wants a 
                man who can perceive the Way of Birth in God?<br/><br/>
    
                <b>Tat:</b> I am incapable of this, O father, then?<br/><br/>
    
                <b>Hermes:</b> Nay, God forbid, my son! Withdraw into thyself, and it will come; will, and it comes to pass; 
                throw out of work the body's senses, and thy Divinity shall come to birth; 
                purge from thyself the brutish torments - things of matter.

                While the union of husband and wife might not seem as paradoxical as the union of being and non-being, order and chaos,
                or good and evil, the union of opposites was nonetheless often depicted as a marriage, and sometimes referred to as 
                the Chemical Marriage (Wedding)
                such as in 'The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz' a German tale published in 1616 about a fictional
                character's trials leading up to his attendance of a royal marriage ceremony.  In the story of the Chymical Wedding, red 
                is mentioned several times, and about a third of those <span class="red">red</span> and 
                <span class="white">white</span> appear together:
        
            <ul class="quote">
                <li>I prepared myself for the way, put on my <span class="white">white</span> linen coat,
                    girded my loins, with a <span class="red">blood-red</span> ribbon bound cross-ways over my shoulder. 
                    In my hat I stuck four <span class="red">red</span> roses, so that I might sooner be noticed
                    amongst the throng by this token</li>
                <li>...and we then imagined
                    nothing other but that the Bridegroom was ready to present himself; which
                    nevertheless was a huge mistake. For it was again the Virgin of yesterday,
                    who had arrayed herself all in <span class="red">red</span> velvet, and girded herself with a 
                    <span class="white">white</span>
                    scarf.</li>
                <li>Her train was now no more of small tapers, but consisted of two hundred men in armour, who were all 
                    (like her) clothed in <span class="red">red</span> and <span class="white">white</span>.</li>
                <li>and I, most
                    unworthy, were to ride alongside the King, each of us bearing a <span class="white">snowwhite</span> 
                    ensign with a <span class="red">red</span> cross</li>
            </ul>
                
        
            <p>
                The Red King and White Queen were also linked with stages of the Magnum Opus, though where they appear in those 
                stages is not consistent nor is the number of stages, and, so far, I have seen that number as 3, 4, 7, and 12.
                In the previously quoted text, Donum Dei, the Great Work is subdivided from four stages into 12 total, reinforcing 
                the connection between transmutation and changes in Nature throughout the year.  
                In the composite of illustrations below
                we see the fourth stage, Putrefaction, and the final two, White Rose and Red Rose
                which depict the Red King and White Queen not united, but as two different phases.

            <p>
                Regardless of how the symbols are employed within the variety of Alchemical texts, the question relevant to this 
                analysis is, how do we spot Alchemical symbolism in a work that isn't known to be Alchemical? When we see Shakespeare, 
                for example, describe Adonis as "More <span class="white">white</span> and <span class="red">red</span> than 
                doves or roses are;" the first reasonable assumption is that Shakespeare is speaking figuratively, not literally here. 
                But, given that, the question that immediately follows is: what context should be used
                for interpreting such language?
                Is Shakespeare painting with Alchemical 
                pigments, riding on the conventions of Renaissance love poetry, perhaps just patriotically 
                enamored of England?  
            </p>
        </div>
       
        <div id="other-contexts">
            <h2>Red and White in Other Contexts</h2>
            <p>Here we have two points to address</p>
            <h3>1. Red and White in Renaissance Love Poetry</h3>
            <p>When reading Shakespeare's Sonnet 130 wherein the poet compares his mistress' eyes to the sun, lips to coral, skin to snow,
                and so on, it would be appropriate to assume he is addressing conventional standards of beauty, at least as expressed in poetry, 
                if only because he is using those comparisons to say what she is NOT, i.e. the ideal Beauty.  
            </p>
            <p class="quote shake">
                My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
                Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
                If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
                If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
                I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
                But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
                And in some perfumes is there more delight
                Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
                I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
                That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
                I grant I never saw a goddess go;
                My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.
                    And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
                    As any she belied with false compare.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shake starts off the poem essentially going through a list of comparisons of visuals, and so we might assume
                all of the use of color here is simply a description of physical appearance compared against convention, or poets who came before.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sir John Suckling makes a similar point in his Sonnet II, where here "red and white" appear to be symbolic of 
                nothing more than external beauty.
            <p class="shake quote">
                Of thee, kind boy, I ask no red and white,
                    To make up my delight;
                    No odd becoming graces,
                Black eyes, or little know-not-whats in faces;
                Make me but mad enough, give me good store
                Of love for her I count;
                    I ask no more,
                ’Tis love in love that makes the sport.

                There’s no such thing as that we beauty call,
                    It is mere cozenage all;
                    For though some, long ago,
                Liked certain colors mingled so and so,
                That doth not tie me now from choosing new;
                If I a fancy take
                    To black and blue,
                That fancy doth it beauty make.

                ’Tis not the meat, but ’tis the appetite
                    Makes eating a delight;
                    And if I like one dish
                More than another, that a pheasant is;
                What in our watches, that in us is found:
                So to the height and nick
                    We up be wound,
                No matter by what hand or trick.
            </p>
                One poem where red and white are used to describe the ideals of beauty is in Philip Sidney's 'Astrophil and Stella' (1591) </p>
       
            <p class="quote shake">
                With the veil of absence, I live in sorrow’s night;
                And if this dark place still shows like a candle-light
                Some portion of beauty, an amber-coloured head of hair,
                Milk-white hands, rosy cheeks, or sweeter, redder lips,
                Or jet-black eyes, in their blackness bright:

                    <span class="citation">--Philip Sidney, Astrophil and Stella 91 (lines 4 - 8)</span>
            </p>
            <p>Note that within these four lines, in describing the ideal beauty, Sidney has used amber, white, red, and black, THE COLORS OF THE 
                FOUR STAGES OF ALCHEMICAL TRANSMUTATION.  If we count the Sun as citrine, Shakespeare has done the same thing in the first four 
                lines of the above sonnet.  Red and White may have become symbols of perfection in love poetry, but is love poetry the chicken 
                or the egg.
            </p>

            <p class="quote shake">
                It is but Love, which makes his paper perfect white
                To write therein more fresh the story of delight,
                While Beauty’s reddest ink Venus for him doth stir.

            <img width="700" src="img/england.png">
            <span class="quote">The flag of England is the Cross of St. George, the dragon-slayer. The red is said to be

            <p>Red and White are prominent colors in English regalia and heraldry, so much that a king draped in red with white fringe
                has become its own icon of kingship. Not only did kings dress in red and white, but so too did dukes, duchesses,
                and their peers. Pictured below, a duke, a duchess, and a king.

            <p>The Wars of the Roses, a decades long war in England between the Houses of York and Lancaster, 
                ended with a marriage.  Henry Tudor, a claimant for the throne from the Lancastrian side effectively 
                brought the conflict to rest with his victory in the battlefield and his marriage to Elizabeth of York, 
                thus beginning the Tudor Dynasty with the blooming of the Tudor Rose.</p>
            <p>William Shakespeare wrote four plays about these wars in the 1590's, about 100 years after the fact.
                He addresses this union in the 
                final play, Richard III:
            </p>
    
            <p class="quote shake">
                Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
                That in submission will return to us.
                And then, as we have ta’en the sacrament,
                We will unite the <span class="white">white</span> rose and the <span class="red">red</span>;
            </p>
        
            <p>The Wars of the Roses were not so called at the time of the warring, and accounts conflict as to whether
                the opposing houses actually used roses as their emblems, leaving suspicion that the creation of the Tudor 
                rose by combining a red rose and a white was a bit of propaganda.  But, if so, was it only a symbolic way of depicting
                a united England? Is it possible that Henry Tudor and Elizabeth of York are the original 
                Red King and White Queen and Alchemists adopted this image in their work?
                Or is it more likely the other way around?

                The roots of Alchemy are ancient and ideas expressed by Alchemists of Renaissance Europe can be found also 
                expressed by Greek philosophers, Indian gurus, or ancient Chinese sages which is to be expected, for Alchemy 
                as both a spiritual and scientific practice ranged from Asia to Europe and is often found intertwined 
                with religion such as with Taoism in China, and Sufism during the Golden Age of Islam. The origins of Alchemical symbols,
                however, especially those used in Renaissance Europe onwards, are 
                not so apparent, which could be because, in European history, there is a gap. The Alchemy of the Greco-Roman world 
                seems to have vanished from Europe with the rise of Christianity, though Christianity arguably has 
                a brand of Alchemy all its own. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Almost a thousand years after the birth of Christ, what is commonly called Alchemy was reintroduced to 
                Christian Europe from various influences including the teachings of  
                Muslim philosophers such as Jabir ibn Hayyan (Geber) and the discovery of the Corpus Hermeticum
                in Macedonia. The general philosophical infusion which brought even Greek 
                philosophy back to the region from which it sprang was a ferment
                in the cultural transformation we call the Renaissance, from the French word for rebirth.
                <!-- That being said, i've yet to find a pre-Renaissance source that uses the Red King and White Queen symbolism.
                Red and white, however, have long had symbolic meaning, but not necessarily as opposites.  -->
            </p>
            <p>With this rebirth of "classical" ideals and values came a contagious interest in Greco-Roman mythology that lasted
                for centuries. The Roman myth of Venus and Adonis was not only the subject of Shakespeare's poem, but of many paintings.

            <h2>A Concoction of Art and Alchemy</h2>
            <p>Art had a different place in the social landscape of the mid-second millennium than it does now. Whereas art in modern 
                times is mostly seen as an avenue for artists to express their emotions or individual identity, to prove their unique genius, 
                or just to make money, 
                artists in the Renaissance, especially among their patrons, were akin to priests, or, more to the point, <i>instruments of God</i>.  
                In Alchemy, Art is seen as a complement to Nature such that we could say: if Nature is God's left hand, Art is God's right.
                Though this is Art in the sense of skill or craft, as in the Art of Healing, when it came to the transformation of society, 
                the Arts as we generalize them (painting, music, poetry, etc.) were seen, as Jesus put it, 
                "like leaven which a woman took and measured and kneaded throughout her dough".
                This perspective is known to have affected works of art (painting) and architecture.  Cathedrals, for example, were often built 
                with the belief that the design of the building itself could facilitate what we might call the religious experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the paintings done from the 1400s - 1700s at least were commissioned by wealthy patrons to serve as such 
                transformative agents.
                Hence, many of these paintings have, as their subject, elements of mythology--which arguably serves the same purpose.  If one looks,
                one might find evidence that the same was true for poetry.
            </p>

                One wealthy family in particular, credited with the flourshing of the Italian Renaissance, was the Medici.
                Cosimo de Medici (1389 to 1464), the founder of the Medici Dynasty was known for his infatuation with exotic philosophical texts coming 
                from outside Christian Europe, notably the Hermetica and NeoPlationist texts. It was he who commissioned Marsilio Ficino 
                to translate the Corpus Hermeticum.  Hermeticism and 
                Alchemy are joined at the hip.
            </p>
            <p>Cosimo I de' Medici (1519-1574), a descendant of Cosimo the Elder's brother, built an Alchemist laboratory in the Palazzo Vecchio 
                (townhall) where his son Francesco is depicted working in the painting on left.  In this laboratory, 
                adorned with paintings and sculptures, artists and alchemists would meet.
            </p>
            <p>The Medici were known for patronizing famous artists such as Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Boticelli. One such patronage
                relevant here was Marie de Medici's patronage of the painter, Peter Paul Rubens.  Browsing the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_de%27_Medici_cycle#:~:text=The%20Marie%20de'%20Medici%20Cycle,in%20the%20autumn%20of%201621.">

                </a>, a series
                of paintings commisioned to Rubens in 1622, the prominence of red and white is apparent.  The two examples below:
                Left: The Education of the Princess (Marie), Right: The Coronation of Marie de Medici
            </p>
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
                <img width="340" src="img/Rubens/0_L'Éducation_de_Marie_de_Médicis_cropped.JPG">
                <img width="340" src="img/Rubens/coronation-of-maria-de-medici_Rubens_cropped.jpg">
            </div>
            <p>In the Education of the Princess, we see the young Marie attended by the Three Graces,  
                as well as a floating man in a winged helmet we can safely assume is Hermes, the patron god of Alchemy, flanked by red 
                and white sheets.
                Compare to Boticelli's 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primavera_%28Botticelli%29"><i>Primavera</i></a> (1470 - 1480),
                also commissioned by the Medici, 
                which has Venus attended by Hermes, the Three Graces, and others. Ruben's
                color division in both paintings is so distinct it does seem he means to make a point.</p>
            <p>Of course, Marie was not the only patron of Rubens. King Philip IV of Spain commissioned him to do a series of more 
                than 60 paintings on themes from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Below are three paintings by Rubens on Venus and Adonis, though who 
                commissioned these I do not know. </p>

            <p>The preponderance of red and white in the paintings of Venus and Adonis might lead us to conclude that these two 
                are the original Red King and White Queen, but as we will see, red and white are often given prominence in paintings 
                of mythological male/female couples, supporting the idea of red and white as representing principles 
                rather than specific characters, or tied with specific names, for Romeo would, were he not Romeo called....
            </p>
            <h2>The Challenger Mars</h2>
            <p>One example of a male/female couple from mythology whose paintings are weighted with red and white, and one of interest 
                here is the pair of lovers, Mars and Venus.
                Mars and Adonis are typically viewed as distinct deities, which is fitting as they are believed to be from distinct traditions, 
                Adonis from Semitic and Mars from Indo-European traditions. And too,
                they are associated with different planets from among the 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_planet">Seven Classical Planets</a>, Adonis  
                with the Sun, Mars with the "red planet".  However, in Alchemy the Sun is not the only heavenly body associated 
                with the masculine principle--so is the planet Mars.  On that note, the Goddess Venus, like the feminine principle of Alchemy,
                wasn't only associated with the planet of her name, but also with the Moon. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Also worth noting that Mars and Venus are the two 
                planets on either side of the Earth in the rank of orbits, which leaves the possibility that they represent 
                the two extremes 
                for which the Earth is

                    Golden Mean</a>.  However, there is a less dubious reason why these two are to be considered in this search.

            <p>Red and white as individual
                colors have had significant symbolic meaning for thousands of years in the general culture. 
                Some of this may be due to nothing more than
                emotional or unconscious
                response to colors in general, a plausilbe explanation for red's regular use in expressing love, and white's seemingly universal 
                association with innocence. Some of red's significance can be attributed to 
                its place among the three primary colors recognized as early as the Roman Empire: red, blue, and yellow,
                which not coincidentally are colors associated with royalty, red being the one most associated with power.
                However, some of the color's significance
                is clearly due to red's association with a chemical compound known from ancient times as cinnabar.

                Cinnabar is a red salt compound of Sulfur and Mercury mined since prehistoric times.
                In practical use, cinnabar was valued as the go-to source of the liquid metal, mercury, and ground into 
                a powder as a pigment, commonly known as vermillion, for red paint.

            <p class="quote">
                The primary prehistoric use of the mineral was grinding it to create vermillion, 
                and its earliest known use for this purpose is at the Neolithic site of Çatalhöyük in Turkey (7000-8000 BC), 
                where wall paintings included cinnabar's vermillion. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thoughtco.com/cinnabar-the-ancient-pigment-of-mercury-170556">

                Being the product of marriage between an acid and a base, salts in general 
                were seen to depict the union of opposites, but among salts, cinnabar was held up as the prime picture. So, Sulfur
                and Mercury were
                also used as symbols for the afore-mentioned king and queen in both Western and Eastern Alchemy, which 
                the Chinese called Yin (Mercury) and Yang (Sulfur). Of course, these two were initially united in one
                essence called Pure Yang (Cinnabar) before separating into their masculine and feminine counterparts. Whether it
                was for qualities possessed by its components or by cinnabar itself, 
                that it held high status is clear.
                In his 'Natural History', the Roman author, Pliny the Elder, states:
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
                (Cinnabar) is of great importance among pigments at the present day, 
                and also in old times it not only had the highest importance but even sacred associations among the Romans. 
                Verrius gives a list of writers of unquestionable authority who say that on holidays it was the custom for 
                the face of the statue of Jupiter himself to be coloured with cinnabar, as well as the bodies of persons going 
                in a triumphal procession, and that Camillus was so coloured in his triumph, and that under the same ritual 
                it was usual even in their day for cinnabar to be added to the unguents used at a banquet in honour of a triumph, 
                and that one of the first duties of the censors was to place a contract for painting Jupiter with cinnabar. 
                For my own part I am quite at a loss to explain the origin of this custom, although at the present day the 
                pigment in question is known to be in demand among the nations of Ethiopia whose chiefs colour themselves all over with it, 
                and with whom the statues of the gods are of that colour.

                Ancients knew how to decompose cinnabar for extracting mercury, but also, how to recompose it.
                Because when cinnabar oxidizes it turns black, it may be the case that splitting
                blackened cinnabar to its component parts, purifying them, and reuniting them again was seen as 
                revivifying dead cinnabar, and thus a picture of spiritual rebirth and plausible 
                template for the traditional four stages of Alchemy for creating the Philosopher's Stone:
                <ol>
                    <li><h4>Nigredo (Blackening):</h4> Cinnabar blackens through exposure to light and humidity</li>
                    <li><h4>Albedo (Whitening):</h4> Dead Cinnabar is heated causing Mercury (feminine) to escape as a white vapor which is then purified</li>
                    <li><h4>Citrinitas (Yellowing):</h4> Sulfur (masculine), a yellow substance, remains which is then purified</li>
                    <li><h4>Rubedo (Reddening):</h4> Cleansed Sulfur and Mercury are merged back together</li>
                </ol>
                The significance of Cinnabar's role in Alchemy is more apparent in the East where its name is synonymous with Alchemy. 
                The Chinese term 'Neidan'(內丹) used for esoteric Taoism or Taoist Alchemy is itself composed of two parts:
                Nei(內 = "inner") and dan(丹) which is often translated as "alchemy" or "elixir" but the online dictionary 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/the-meaning-of/chinese-word-330be19f33461a3b2e8600d827856e04a46922bf.html">
                    wordhippo.com</a>
                gives
                the definition of 丹 as: red, cinnabar, pellet, powder.  
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
                In China, the earliest known use of cinnabar is the Yangshao culture (~4000-3500 BC). At several sites, 
                cinnabar covered the walls and floors in buildings used for ritual ceremonies. Cinnabar was among a range of minerals 
                used to paint Yangshao ceramics, and, at Taosi village, cinnabar was sprinkled into elite burials.

                It is supposedly for this symbolic significance of cinnabar that 
                the Chinese flag is red. Red in general was seen as the zenith of colors and, like gold, the champion of metals, 
                was linked with the Sun.  So, also in Japan red is linked with the Sun, but more specifically with the Shinto
                Sun-goddess, Amaterasu, who is often depicted in art like the Japanese flag, in red and white.

                <p>Cinnabar is is still used for devotional offerings in India where the mineral is known as sindoor. 
                    Like the statues of deities painted with cinnabar by the Romans, 
                    idols known as linga or lingam which represent the 
                    generative principle of the Universe or Shiva as a penis (aka 'shiva lingam') are ritually 
                    dosed with sindoor creating an image that emphasizes the association between 
                    cinnabar, potency, and marriage.

                In addition, the red bindi dot that married women in India wear between their eyes, a symbol of the 
                third eye, and thus of Enlightenment, was for thousands of years painted on with vermilion, known in India as sindoor, itself a symbol of marriage. 
                This tradition began 
                in the Harappan civilisation which existed in India from 3300–1300 BCE and persisted until 
                it was discovered that mercury is toxic.

                Bindi is the feminine form of bindu, the white "point" from which the universe germinated in Shaivism
                described as a white seed (masculine) in red fleshy fruit (feminine), which together are the hermaphrodite deity, 
                Shiva-Shakti.
                
            </p>

            <p>
                The description of Shiva-Shakti as a white seed in red fleshy fruit is opposite the typical Alchemical pairing of 
                color and gender, and is 
                also opposite the pomegranate, a fruit with red seeds and white flesh, though the skin is red... The pomegranate 
                has/had significant symbolic meaning around the world.

            <img width="700" src="img/madonna.jpg">
        

            <p>In Sandro Botticeli's 'Madonna of the Pomegranate' (1487) the baby Jesus holds an open pomegranate over his heart, 
                suggesting that its seeds are analogous to the seeds of the Logos which pour out like drops 
                of blood, for the pomegranate is a symbol of resurrection and the Passion of the Christ in Christianity. 
                The Sufi poet Rumi ties the pomegranate, the red anemone and Alchemy together in this short poem, which likens
                the opening of the pomegranate to the opening of the heart, and thus the ripe pomegranate to the spiritually mature:
            </p>
        
            <p class="quote shake">
                If you buy a pomegranate, buy one whose ripeness
                has caused it to be cleft open
                with a seed-revealing smile.

                Its laughter is a blessing, for through its wide-open mouth
                it shows its heart,
                like a pearl in the jewel box of spirit.

                The red anemone laughs, too,
                but through its mouth you glimpse a blackness.

                A laughing pomegranate
                brings the whole garden to life.
                Keeping the company of the holy
                makes you one of them
                Whether you are stone or marble,
                you will become a jewel
                when you reach a human being of heart.

                Plant the love of the holy ones within your spirit;
                don’t give your heart to anything
                but the love of those whose hearts are glad.
                Don’t go to the neighborhood of despair:
                there is hope.
                Don’t go in the direction of darkness:
                suns exist.

                The heart guides you to the neighborhood of the saints;
                the body takes you to the prison of water and earth.
                Give your heart the food of holy friends;
                seek maturity from those who have matured.
            </p>
            <p>The pomegranate was also a sacred object to Aphrodite/Venus and, along with fertility, symbolized the loss of virginity
                in the consummation of marriage in her religion or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AphroditeTreasures.html">
                    symbolism associated with the Goddess
                </a>. Coupling this symbolism of the pomegranate with the opening of the heart provides
                a possible link with the Sacred Marriage as a spirtual awakening that is a "popping of the pomegranate",
                an opening of the heart which is not only a catharsis or 
                release,
                but a loss of virginity, a yielding and willingness to be spiritually penetrated or even dominated, in the sense that even 
                men have to take the woman's role. 
            </p>
            <h2>Summing the Account</h2>
            <p>So, we have reason to believe that red's symbolism in Alchemy has a natural 
                precedent, possibly more than one, which can serve as foundation for parabolic
                interpretations.  That red would represent the final stage
                in Alchemical transmutation makes sense if the synthesizing of cinnabar is seen to illustrate the Chemical Marriage,
                though why red and white would be representatives of gender in that case doesn't fit, as red would be androgynous or 
                hermaphrodite. 
            </p>
            <p>We also have evidence of red and white appearing together in cultural/religious contexts outside of Christian Europe 
                where red and white were established as colors for nobility and royalty.
            </p>Pending further research, it appears that the Red King and White Queen became prominent symbols in European Alchemy 
                during the Renaissance, but seem to have evolved out of more ancient uses of the colors.

            <h2>Shakespeare's Inspiration and Introduction to the Poem</h2>
            <p>Shakespeare's poem 'Venus and Adonis' is inaugurated with a Latin quote from the Roman poet Horace:</p>
            <p class="quote shake">
                Vilia miretur vulgus: mihi flavus Apollo
                Pocula Castalia plena ministret aqua.
            </p>
            <p>Translation:</p>
            <p class="quote shake">
                Let the vulgar crowd admire cheap things; let yellow Apollo
                Serve me with cups full of Castalian water.
            </p>
            <p>The last part of the quote alludes to the Castalian spring
                at Delphi where Apollo killed Python and established his oracle.  The spring was associated with prophecy
                and poetic inspiration.  Apparently, Shakespare, or the publisher, here is saying he is only concerned with 
                divinely inspired works.
                
                </p>
            <p>Even if Shakespeare's poem was divinely inspired, it wasn't created ex nihilo. 
                It is believed that Shakespeare based his poem
                primarily on a tale of the two deities in Ovid's 'Metamorphoses' (8 CE) though he may have been inspired
                by other stories in the same book for transformation myths centering on a love pursuit is a common motif in
                the book and in  
                Greco-Roman mythology in general.  There are at least 3 transformation myths centering on a nymph or goddess pursuing
                a man she is in love with in Ovid's Metamorphoses:
                <ol>
                    <li>Venus and Adonis</li>
                    <li>Echo and Narcissus</li>
                    <li>Salmacis and Hermaphroditus</li>
    
                </ol>
                The similarity between the first two gives cause to believe they are variations of the same myth.  The third differs in 
                such a way that it can't go without mentioning.   
                </p>

        <div id="analysis">
            <h2>Analysis of the Poem</h2>
            <p>Initially the plan was only to count how many times the words "red" and "white" or words which imply those colors, such as 
              "blushing" and "pale" appeared together either in the same verse or in the same stanza.  As there are 199 stanzas of 6 verses 
              each = 1194 verses, this seemed
              like a good opportunity to try the programming language Python to accelerate the process but then the question became, how do
              I come up with an adequate list of words to search for? Seeing as it is Shakespeare, the prospect of trying to think of words
              that might be used seemed inadequate in a way that I could hear the creator of his own vocabulary rolling in his grave.  
              Not only might I miss numerous
              words, but also, why search for words that aren't there?  So, I used Python to count unique words in the text and put them into 
              a <a  href="python/outputfile.csv">CSV file</a> which lists the 2574 unique words and the number of times each appears in the text.
             
              </p>
            
              <p>Going through the list to find relevant words I noticed a lot of pairs of opposites and so gave the list to ChatGPT and 
                asked the bot to sort out pairs of opposites from it. It returned a list of more than 60 pairs. Some of those were 
                redundant such as quick/slow and fast/slow, and some had been missed.  So, I addded and removed from the original list of pairs 
                and settled on 72 pairs simply for the sake of presentation--if 72 pairs doesn't make the point, 73 won't either.  Note that 
                only single words are searched for here and more opposites would likely be found if phrases were included, such as danger / 
                "where never serpent hisses", nor did I include traditional Alchemical pairings: gold / silver, sun / moon, fire / water or red / white.

            <p>Resuming the search for red and white, the list of unique words posed its own challenges as I meant to include words 
              that imply color such as blood, snow, milk, etc. as I already know they are used for such purposes--as in the following verses </p>
            <p class="quote shake">
              Whose <span class="white">frothy</span> mouth bepainted all with <span class="red">red</span>,
              Like <span class="white">milk</span> and <span class="red">blood</span> being mingled both together,
            </p>
            <p> but where to draw the line?  Coming up with 
              a list of red and white terms was to serve two purposes.
              <ol>
                <li>to compare all colors by count</li>
                <li>to count pairings of red and white terms within stanzas and verses.</li>
              </ol>
              The word "<span class="red">fire</span>" Shakespeare uses three times to imply red or with red, but fire is 
              used 14 times in the text and most of those it appears only to imply heat, anger, love, or passion, more than color.  
              For the color comparision, fire was left out of the grouping of red, though the results show that including 
              it would 
              be superfluous.

            Using the list of red and white terms above, a second search was done using Python to find stanzas and verses where a red and white term 
            appear together.  One change to the list was made though. Purple was added to the red column, as purple didn't mean in Shakespeare's time what 
            it does now, i.e. a mix of red and blue, but could be used for a range of hue from violet to dark or rich reds.  Twice in the poem, Shakespeare
            uses purple to denote the color of blood. It was put in its own column above simply for the benefit of the doubt.

                stanza above (195)  
                In Stanza 2 is a description of Adonis (as a flower) by Venus and the last is of the flower that grows from his blood, 
                "resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood which in round drops upon their whiteness stood."</p>
            <p>
                Recall that in the Orphic Hymn, Adonis is called "Sweet plant of Aphrodite (Venus), Love's (Eros/Cupid)
                delightful flower."
            </p>
            <p>While white and red in Stanza 2 could be taken at first glance to be a conventional way of saying Adonis is beautiful, or even 
                the most beautiful flower in the field, the red on the flower at the end gives us a different meaning. And if 
                the red crown anenomone is supposed to be a reminder to us of the fate of Adonis, what is the point?
            </p>
            <p>
                The last two lines are peculiar and seem like an overblown exagerration, unless we consider 
                the idea of Adonis as a "flower of fire".
                An idea implied later in the poem when Adonis dies and Venus responds:
            </p>
            <p class="quote shake">
                For, he being dead, with him is beauty slain,
                And, beauty dead, black chaos comes again.

            <p>A peculiar stanza, here Venus is telling Adonis to not make himself sick by overindulging on the sweetness of kissing, 
                but to refrain just enough that his lips become both red and pale, perhaps meant to be a sign of 
                balance in love here.  Lips in love poetry are typically red,
                and so having them "red and pale with fresh variety" seems to have less to do with sexual appeal and 
                more to do with the interaction and intermingling of 
                of the pair, an idea we see again.

        Over one arm the lusty courser’s rein
        Under her other was the tender boy

        With leaden appetite unapt to toy
            She <span class="red">red</span> and hot as coals of glowing fire

            <p>one point of interest here is the use of "dull" and "leaden" (lead is base largely because it is dull) 
                to describe both Adonis' disdain and his sexual appetite recalling "heavy Saturn" in Sonnet 98.  Also, 
                Adonis being "unapt to toy" recalls what Venus said about Mars when she claims credit for teaching the direful 
                god of war "to sport and dance, to toy, to wanton, dally, smile, and jest".  Toy in Shakepseare's time meant 
                to be playful, frivolous, or flirtatious. Here the use of red and white is put to new use reinforcing this
                idea of Adonis was one bashful, unapt to toy, for here red is used to illustrate his shame, white to illustrate 
                his frigidity.

                Once again red is for shame, but now white is tied with anger as Adonis becomes increasingly frustrated. 
                The last two lines are a complete mystery, and the idea expressed at the beginning of the poem of Adonis being white and red 
                seems less to do with his cheeks and lips, and more to do with his nature.  Ignoring all other uses, red and white 
                appear in the next to last line to mean shameful and angry as in the line just before. Worth noting that despite being 
                associated with spiritual perfection, red and white as representatives of the masculine and feminine principles 
                have their "negative" qualities, but here, Venus loves them regardless.

        O! what a sight it was wistly to view

            <p>Though the tension had been building in the previous stanzas, the conflict has now moved to Venus' face. 
                This is not the fresh variety of red and white intermingling in Adonis' lips, but a war between them.
                Here we have correspondence with an Alchemical text which describes the battle between water
                and fire.
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
                If much water be poured upon a little fire, 
                the fire is overcome, and compelled to yield up the victory to the water. In the same way our fiery sulphur 
                must be overcome by means of our prepared water. But, after the water has vanished, the fiery life of our sulphurous 
                vapour must triumph, and again obtain the victory. But no such triumph can take place unless the King imparts 
                great strength and potency to his water and tinges it with his own colour, that thereby he may be consumed and become 
                invisible, and then again recover his visible form, with a diminution of his simple essence, and a development of his perfection.
            </p>
            <p>Shakespeare similarly has a conflict between red and white in the face of Lucrece in his poem 'The Rape of Lucrece'

            <p class="quote shake">
                When at Collatium this false lord arrived,
                Well was he welcomed by the Roman dame,
                Within whose face Beauty and Virtue strived
                Which of them both should underprop her fame.
                When Virtue bragged, Beauty would blush for shame;
                  When Beauty boasted blushes, in despite
                  Virtue would stain that o’er with silver white.
      
                But Beauty, in that white entitulèd
                From Venus’ doves doth challenge that fair field.
                Then Virtue claims from Beauty Beauty’s red,
                Which Virtue gave the golden age to gild
                Their silver cheeks, and called it then their shield,
                  Teaching them thus to use it in the fight:
                  When shame assailed, the red should fence the white.
      
                This heraldry in Lucrece’ face was seen,
                Argued by Beauty’s red and Virtue’s white.
                Of either’s color was the other queen,
                Proving from world’s minority their right.
                Yet their ambition makes them still to fight,
                  The sovereignty of either being so great
                  That oft they interchange each other’s seat.

            <p>As pointed out already, this stanza recalls Stanza 2 which describes Adonis as a flower, but furthermore 
                it recalls the very first stanza of the poem which describes the purple-coloured face of the Sun taking 
                its last leave of the weeping morn.
            </p>

            <p>The purple blood on Adonis' face in death is analogous to the purple face of the Sun as it sets, i.e. it is "blood-colored".
                And, like women of Rome weeping 
                for Adonis, the morn in Shakespeare's poem is "weeping" for the Sun who has "ta'en his last leave". 
                So, not only does the setting sun foreshadow the death of Adonis,
                but furthermore points to the idea that the myth has its origin in the Sun's cycle, as if Shakespeare is saying:
                Had Adonis paid attention to the sign in the sky, he wouldn't have gone on the chase.
